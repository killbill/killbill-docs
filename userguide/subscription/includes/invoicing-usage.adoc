==== Usage Invoice Items

As described in the section http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#components-catalog-usage[Usage Billing],
Kill Bill supports invoicing customers based on different usage types. The usage billing is always done on a per subscription
level and for a given billing period; in addition, if the active `Plan` associated with the subscription contains multiple usage
sections, each usage section is billed independently: As a result, we may see one or several `USAGE` invoice items per invoice,
each associated with a given subscription, usage section and billing period.

Regardless of the usage type the following basic fields will always be seen:

* `planName`: The name of the `Plan` in the catalog
* `phaseName`: The name of the `PlanPhase` in the catalog
* `subscriptionId`: The ID of the subscription
* `usageName`: The name of the usage section in the catalog
* `startDate`: The start date for the period being invoiced
* `endDate`: The end date for the period being invoiced

In addition, depending on the usage type for the usage section (e.g `CONSUMABLE`), and depending on the configuration of the system,
we may see additional information. 

==== Capacity In Arrear Mode

This mode bills based on actual usage, using a fixed price for the highest tier reached. For each capacity in arrear usage section, we will see some json in the field `itemDetails`, to provide additional information:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "tierDetails": [
    {
      "tier": 2,
      "tierUnit": "bandwith-meg-sec",
      "tierPrice": 10,
      "quantity": 200
    },
    {
      "tier": 3,
      "tierUnit": "members",
      "tierPrice": 100,
      "quantity": 60
    }
  ],
  "amount": 100
}
----

In this example we see that we were invoiced for 2 different units, and this shows the tier details for each unit, and the amount that will be charged.
Because unit `members` reached tier 3, the amount will be based on the pricing for this tier.

==== Consumable In Arrear Mode

This mode bills for each unit based on actual usage, using a price determined by the tier(s) reached and by the policy. With the `ALL_TIER` policy, usage within each tier is charged according to the price for that tier. With the `TOP_TIER` policy, all usage is charged according to the price for the highest tier reached. 

We can configure the invoicing system to output one amount per tier (Detail Mode), or a single amount for all tiers (Aggregate Mode). The example below illustrates each mode for the `ALL_TIER` policy.

==== Aggregate Mode

In the aggregate mode, we will see one `USAGE` item with the aggregate amount across units and tiers. The `itemDetails` json will summarize the usage on a per tier basis and per unit basis:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "tierDetails": [
    {
      "tier": 1,
      "tierUnit": "cell-phone-minutes",
      "tierPrice": 2,
      "tierBlockSize": 1,
      "quantity": 20,
      "amount": 40
    },
    {
      "tier": 2,
      "tierUnit": "cell-phone-minutes",
      "tierPrice": 20,
      "tierBlockSize": 1,
      "quantity": 100,
      "amount": 2000
    },
    {
      "tier": 1,
      "tierUnit": "Mbytes",
      "tierPrice": 10,
      "tierBlockSize": 1,
      "quantity": 10,
      "amount": 100
    }
  ],
  "amount": 2140
}
----

In this example, we have billed for two unit types: `cell-phone-minutes` and `Mbytes`. For `cell-phone-minutes`, the quantity recorded for the period reached the maximum for tier 1 and extended into tier 2. Since we are using the `ALL_TIER` policy, the amount for each tier is computed separately, giving 40 for tier 1 and 2000 for tier 2. For the `Mbytes` units, all usage remained in tier 1, so a single amount, 100, is computed. The amount reported is the sum of the individual amounts: 40 + 2000 + 100 = 2140.

If we were instead using the `TOP_TIER` policy, all usage of `cell-phone-minutes` would be billed at the tier 2 price (20) for a total of 2400, so the aggregate amount reported would be 2500.

==== Detail Mode

Sometimes it is desirable to output one `USAGE` item per unit type and tier, so in this case the detail for the billing is inside each
invoice item, and the aggregate amount is computed by summing all the amounts. In order to activate this mode, one needs to set
the system property `org.killbill.invoice.item.result.behavior.mode` to `DETAIL`.

Each of the `USAGE` items will contain the following fields:

* `quantity`: Quantity consumed for the unit (type) and on the given tier
* `rate`: The `rate` field normally reserved for the `RECURRING` type is used to output the price of the tier

Also, the `itemDetails` json field will provide some additional details:

[source,bash]
----
{
  "tier": 1,
  "tierUnit": "cell-phone-minutes",
  "tierPrice": 2,
  "tierBlockSize": 1,
  "quantity": 20,
  "amount": 40
}
----


==== Past Usage Periods

By default the system is configured to look at the past 2 billing periods, but this can be changed by using the configuration `org.killbill.invoice.readMaxRawUsagePreviousPeriod` (default=2). Let's assume a MONTHLY subscription that was invoiced for the following periods:

* `2018-01-01 - 2018-02-01`
* `2018-02-01 - 2018-03-01`
* `2018-03-01 - 2018-04-01`

On `2018-05-01`, the system will by default look to invoice for the period `2018-04-01 - 2018-05-01`, but it will also recompute items for the past 2 periods, `2018-03-01 - 2018-04-01` and `2018-02-01 - 2018-03-01`.

Late Usage Data:

If for some reason, there is some late usage reported in these past 2 periods, the system will include this delta. Depending on the type of usage and mode (e.g `AGGREGATE`) we will see one or several `USAGE` item for this period to reflect this additional charge. If the late usage is older than these past 2 periods, it is simply ignored.

Missing Usage Data:

Currently it is considered an error to delete past usage data in these past 2 periods. If this occurs, the invoicing system throws an error and prevents invoicing from happening correctly. If the late missing data is older than these past 2 periods, it is simply ignored.

One can set the system property -- or per-tenant config -- `org.killbill.invoice.readMaxRawUsagePreviousPeriod` to `0` to ignore any past data -- late usage or missing data.
