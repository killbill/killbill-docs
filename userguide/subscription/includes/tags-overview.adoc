Kill Bill offers the ability to tag resources (account, invoice, payment, subscription, etc.) in the system. There are two main types of tags:

* `User tags`: These tags are not interpreted by the system; they are a convenient way for admins or third party systems to annotate specific existing resources. For instance, the support team could tag account resources associated with a specific customer to group them.
* `Control tags`: These tags modify the behavior of the system. The following control tags can be associated with an account:
** AUTO_PAY_OFF: When this tag is set, the system will not attempt to trigger automatic payments from this account after invoices have been generated. When the tag is removed, the system will immediately attempt to issue the payments that were not made.
** AUTO_INVOICING_OFF: When this tag is set, the system will not attempt to invoice the customer. When the tag is removed, the system will immediately attempt to issue invoices for the account.
** OVERDUE_ENFORCEMENT_OFF: When this tag is set, the system will not attempt to change the account into an overdue state regardless of any potential failed payments. When the tag is removed, the system will immediately recompute the current overdue state.
** MANUAL_PAY: When this tag is set, the system will not attempt to trigger automatic payments after invoices have been generated. The intent of this tag is to allow the customer to make his payment outside of Kill Bill.
** TEST: This tag is used by the analytics plugin to prevent this account from being included in the set of accounts.
** PARTNER: This tag is used by the analytics plugin so the account can be interpreted differently.
* The following control tag is associated with a specific invoice:
** WRITTEN_OFF: This tag indicates that the balance for this invoice should be ignored by the system.
