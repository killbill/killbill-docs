*Account* - An object representing a customer account. It contains details about the customer such as name, address, email address, phone number, etc.

*Bundle* - A collection of subscriptions associated with a single service instance. For example, a customer might have a base subscription for her phone plus an addon that provides cheap international dialing. Because both Subscriptions are associated with the same phone, they are collected into a single Bundle. An account may own several Bundles, each with one or more Subscriptions.  

*Catalog* - A description of the set of Products, Plans, Price Lists and Rules that are being made available to customers. A catalog lets Kill Bill know what is being offered for sale and how much to charge for it.

*Payment Method* - A record of the details required for Kill Bill to trigger a payment. Payment Methods represent things like credit cards, debit cards, or PayPal accounts. Each Account can have many Payment Methods and at most one Default Payment Method. Note that much of the representation of a Payment Method is plugin-specific and is actually stored by the Payment Plugin itself.

*Plan* - A Catalog object that defines how a Product is to be paid for. Plans can have multiple phases (e.g. trial, discount, evergreen). The phase specifies the frequency of payment and the prices in multiple currencies. Each phase can have fixed and recurring prices associated with it. Each Product can have multiple Plans specifying different ways that the Product can be purchased (e.g. a monthly Plan and an annual Plan).

*Price list* - A collection of Plans that might be associated with a particular program (e.g. an affiliate program or a discount program). A Plan can be in many Price Lists. There must be a default Price List that is used when no Price List is specified. When a Subscription changes Plans, Catalog Rules can be used to determine which Price List the new Plan should use.

*Product* - A product or service that the customer buys.

*Subscription* - A contract that associates an account with a Plan and a specific start date. The Subscription will trigger automated payments based on the terms of the Plan.

*Tag* - A property that can be added to Accounts, Bundles or Subscriptions. There are two kinds of Tags: System Tags and User Tags. System Tags can impact the behaviour of the system. Examples include AUTO_PAY_OFF or AUTO_BILLING_OFF. User Tags are informational only, and can be created through the admin UI. User Tags are used to identify collections of Users, Subscriptions or Bundles so that they can easily be found or reported on later.
