== How to Use This Guide

<<part_1_navigation_and_interface>> explains how to *navigate* in Kaui and its *basic interface features*.

<<part_2_accounts>> explains how to perform the basic tasks for administering *customer accounts*, such as creating accounts, invoices, and so forth. It’s appropriate for back office staff, such as those working in customer service, product management, and finance.

<<part_3_users_roles_permissions>> explains how to create and manage *users* as well as *users roles* and *permissions*. It’s appropriate for Kill Bill administrators and software developers.

Advanced features are covered in Parts 4 - 6:

* <<part_4_tags_and_custom_fields>>
* <<part_5_plugin_manager_and_analytics>>
* <<part_6_tenants_and_admin>>

The <<faqs>> are great for *basic questions* like, _How do I create an invoice?_

=== About Screenshots
The screenshots displayed in this guide may differ from what you see on your Kaui screen. That's because your user permissions control what features you can access (i.e., what you see on the screen).

If you have any questions about why your Kaui screen doesn't match what you see in this guide, ask your Kaui administrator.

== Other Learning Resources

=== Videos
We regularly add new overviews and tutorials to https://www.youtube.com/c/KillbillIoOSS[our YouTube videos], so check in from time to time.

== Part 1 - Navigation and Interface [[part_1_navigation_and_interface]]

=== What Is Kaui?
"Kaui" (KAUI) stands for Kill (Bill) Admin User Interface. This self-contained web application interacts with Kill Bill over HTTPS.

Backoffice staff (for example, Support or Finance) will find Kaui useful to process refunds, credits, chargebacks, and so forth. Kaui also enables the Kill Bill administrator to perform more advanced tasks, such as managing tags, deploying plugins, and configuring the tenant(s).

Other types of users who might find Kaui useful are developers (for testing), operations, and product managers.

[NOTE]
For Developers: Kaui functionality is provided via a series of Ruby on Rails mountable engines. You can extend its functionality (for example, to provide a custom UI for your plugins) by mounting your own engine(s).

=== What You Can Do in Kaui

In Kaui, users can  perform basic tasks, such as:

* Create a customer account
* Generate a customer invoice
* Cancel a subscription

However, Kaui can also help advanced users perform tasks, for example:

* Adding a plugin to Kill Bill
* Managing Kill Bill users
* Creating tags or custom fields

These are just a handful of the tasks you can accomplish with Kaui. For a full list, see the _Table of Contents_ at the beginning of this guide.

=== Sign In and Sign Out [[log_in_and_log_out]]

To sign in to Kaui, type in your username and password, then select the *Sign In* button.

If your organization uses more than one Kill Bill tenant, select the tenant from the dropdown and select the *Save* button:

image::ChooseTenant.png[width=650,align="center"]

[NOTE]
*Note:* Authentication is handled by Kill Bill. The method your organization uses to manage users is highly configurable. For information on managing users and permissions, see <<part_3_users_roles_permissions>>.

To log out of Kaui, select *SIGN OUT* in the upper right corner of the Kill Bill homepage:

== Part 2 - Accounts [[part_2_accounts]]

This section helps you become familiar with customer accounts and the layout of the Account page.

The Account page provides information about a specific customer, such as email address, physical address, and so forth. It is also the central location for the customer's billing information, subscriptions, invoices, and payment methods.

To find a customer in the system, use <<Basic Search>> or <<Advanced Search>>. To open the customer account, click the customer ID in the search results.

The next section explains how the Account page is laid out. To skip this and see the task-based steps, go to <<Create an Account>>.

=== Account Page Layout

The Account page has the following sections:

1. Sub-menu
2. Account information
3. Billing info
4. Personal info
5. Payment methods

image::AccountPage_Labeled.png[]

[%unbreakable]
--
*1. Account Sub-Menu*

The *Account* sub-menu organizes and provides access to different areas of the customer's account:

* Subscriptions
* Invoices
* Payments
* Timeline
* Tags
* Custom Fields
--

image::Account-Submenu.png[width=650,align="center"]

To see these areas, click the relevant item on the sub-menu. To return to the customer's Account page, click *Account* on the sub-menu.

*2. Account Information*

This section of the screen displays a summary of the customer's account information, such as their ID, currency, and time zone. To edit this information, click *Edit* next to Account Information.

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer account:

* <<Edit an Account>>
* <<Link to Parent Account>>
* <<Add a Tag to an Account>>

*3. Personal Information*

This section of the screen displays the customer's personal contact information (read only).

By default, Personal Information details are hidden for GDPR Compliance and customer privacy. To see the information, click *Show/Hide Content*.

To edit this information, see the <<Edit an Account>> section.

*4. Billing Info*

Here you can perform the following tasks for the customer:

* Pay all invoices
* Add a credit
* Create a charge

//LINK THE ABOVE LATER

You can also see a summary of billing information:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
^|Field ^|Description

|Account balance
|Amount of money due on the account, including any account credits.

|Account credit
|Amount of any money owed to the customer.

|Overdue status
|The status of the customer's account that indicates if they are overdue or up-to-date on their invoice payments.

*Note:* The account can have a negative account balance, but not be overdue. That's because overdue status depends on invoice due dates and how late payments are defined based on a company's business policy. For example, an invoice may not be overdue if a company allows a 15-day grace period (a.k.a. NET terms) to make a payment.

|Bill cycle day (BCD)
|The day of the month on which the system generates an invoice for this account. This field applies to accounts that are subscribed to monthly subscriptions (or a multiple of monthly, such as quarterly, annually, etc.). For more information, see the <<Account Field Descriptions>> table.

|Next invoice date
|The date on which the system generates the customer's next invoice.

|===

The *Trigger invoice generation* feature lets you generate an invoice, either as a test or in a committed state.

*5. Payment Methods*

This section of the Account page lets you:

* <<_add_payment_method,Add a payment method>>
* <<_set_a_payment_method_as_the_default,Set a payment method as default>>
* <<_delete_payment_method,Delete a payment method>>
* <<_applying_transactions_to_a_payment_method,Apply a transaction to a payment method (authorize, charge, credit, etc.)>>

For more information on payment methods, see the <<_payment_methods>> section.

=== Create an Account

1. At the top right of the screen, click *Create New Account*:

image::CreateNewAccount-Labeled.png[width=650,align="center"]

[start=2]
. Kaui opens the Add New Account screen:

image::AddNewAccount.png[width=550,align="center"]

[start=3]
. Fill in the fields. For field descriptions, see the table in the next section.

[start=4]
. Click the *Save* button.

<<<
==== Account Field Descriptions

[cols="1,3"]
|===
^|Field ^|Description

|Name
|The customer's first and last name.

|First name length
|This field sets the length of the customer's first name. Kill Bill automatically calculates this number based on the location of the space between the first and last name. You can overwrite it with a different number, if necessary.

*Note:* This field is used if your organization needs to extract customers' first or last names for communication (invoices, emails, etc.). The field lets an organization accommodate variations of names used across the globe.

|External key
|An optional alternate ID for the account. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Tip:* The external key feature is helpful if you integrate Kill Bill with another system, such as a CRM, and want to use that system's ID in Kill Bill (for identification, searching, and so forth). Once this is set and saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

|Email
|The main email address to use for communicating with the customer.

|Bill cycle day (BCD)
|For monthly or quarterly subscriptions, what day of the month the invoice is created. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

*Note:* The system has three types of billing (date) alignment that affect the BCD: `ACCOUNT`, `SUBSCRIPTION`, and `BUNDLE`. For more information about the three billing alignment types, see https://docs.killbill.io/latest/catalog-examples.html[_Catalog Examples_] and
https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html#_billing_alignment_rules["Billing Alignment Rules"] in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[_Subscription_ manual].

|Currency
|The currency that the customer uses to make purchases. Once this is saved for the customer, you cannot change it.

2. In the Personal Information section, click the gray down arrow ( image:i_GrayDownArrow.png[] ) to expand the section.
3. Next to the email you want to delete, click the red X ( image:i_RedX.png[] ). Kaui immediately deletes the email address.

=== Close an Account
Use the steps in this section to indicate you will no longer be doing business with a customer. If the customer has unpaid invoices, using the steps below, you can choose to either write off or item-adjust them.

[NOTE]
*Note:* Closing an account does not delete it. It only indicates the account is no longer a customer of yours. Once you close the account, its data becomes read-only, and you cannot make changes to it.

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. Next to Account Information, click *Close*.

Kaui displays the *Close Account* pop-up:

image::CloseAccountPopup.png[width=450,align="center"]

[start=3]
. Check the *Name* and *Account ID* fields to ensure you are closing the correct account.
. Toggle any of the following options:
* *Cancel All Subscriptions*&#8212;Stops any subscriptions that are current for this account.
* *Write Off Unpaid Invoices*&#8212;Brings the balance for all unpaid invoices to zero. When you choose to write off the invoice, it is removed from Account Receivables.
* *Item Adjust Unpaid Invoices*&#8212;Adds an invoice line item with a negative amount to bring each unpaid invoice's balance to zero.

[NOTE]
*Note:* The last two options are mutually exclusive (i.e., you can only select one of them).

[start=5]
. Click the *Close* button.

Kaui displays a message that lets you know the account was closed. In addition, the *Account* sub-menu displays "Closed:"

image::AccountSubmenu-Closed.png[width=650,align="center"]

=== Add a Tag to an Account

A "tag" is a way to attach specific information to an account (_Example:_ `good_user`) or a specify a certain behavior (_Example:_ `AUTO_INVOICING_OFF`). Kill Bill includes two types of tags:

* *System tags:* Written in ALL CAPS characters, system tags can affect the behavior of the system.
* *User tags:* Written in all lowercase characters, user tags do not affect the object they're attached to. User tabs are for informational purposes only.

For more information on Tags, including a list of default tags, see the https://killbill.github.io/slate/#account-tags["Tag" section] in the https://killbill.github.io/slate/[_REST API Reference Manual_].

To add a tag to a customer account:

1. Open the account on the Account page.
2. In the Account Information section, click the tag icon in the upper left corner:

image::AccountInfo-Section-Labeled.png[width=550,align="center"]

[start=3]
. Select the checkboxes of the tags you want to assign to the account.

image::Account-TagDropdown.png[width=550,align="center"]

[start=4]
. Click the *Update* button to save your changes.

<<<
=== Link to Parent Account

When you link an account to a _parent_ account, the account becomes a _child_ account. Defining a parent-child association between accounts lets you define which entity is responsible for paying the invoice. For more information on this feature, see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/ha.html[_Hierarchical Accounts Tutorial_].

1. As a preparation step, open the parent account and copy the account ID in the Account Information section.
2. Open the account that will become the child account.
3. In the Account Information section of the child account, click the plus sign icon (image:i_PlusGreen.png[]) next to the *Parent* field:

image::Account-ParentField-Labeled.png[width=550,align="center"]

Kaui opens a pop-up:

image::LinkToParentPopup.png[width=550,align="center"]

[start=4]
. Click in the *Parent account id* field and paste in the account ID that you copied in step 1.
. To set the parent as responsible for all payments associated with this account, check the *Is payment delegated to a parent?* box. If you do not check this box, the child account is responsible for its own payments.

[start=6]
. Click the *Save* button. Kaui displays the parent account ID as a link in the Account Information section.

image::Account-ParentID-Labeled.png[width=550,align="center"]

You can open the parent account by clicking the account ID link.

=== Payment Methods

A customer account can have several payment methods to allow for making payments in different ways, such as credit cards, debit cards, PayPal, and so forth. The payment method includes the details needed for Kill Bill to process a payment against an invoice.

Saving this information in Kaui makes it easier to accept payments from the customer because the customer or service staff don't need to repeatedly provide their payment method details.

In production systems, payment method information is typically added via gateway-specific data flows. However, developers can use the Payment Method section for testing purposes.

[NOTE]
*Note:*Although you can't edit a payment method, you can delete it.

[WARNING]
*Warning!* For PCI compliance, _do not_ enter any genuine payment information in these fields.

==== About Payment Plugin Names

Each payment method is associated with a payment plugin, a type of software that performs the backend processing for that specific payment method. The *Plugin name* field specifies the name of this payment plugin. (_Example:_ `killbill-stripe`).

The plugin name is typically mentioned in the plugin's `readme` file. For example, in the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-stripe-plugin#using-stripe-checkout[Stripe plugin `readme` file], the plugin name is specified in the command line.

==== View Payment Method Details
