= Plugin Development

This document can be used as a guide to develop custom plugins.

== Scope

* How to start plugin development?
* Tooling and APIs to build and deploy plugins

== Where to Start?

We provide a sample https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin[_hello world plugin_] which can be used as the starting point for developing a custom plugin. 

In addition, we have separate docs for different types of plugins. A good starting point would be to assess what the plugin should do and then based on that, read the various docs that describe the different types of plugins offered in Kill Bill:

* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/catalog_plugin.html[Catalog Plugin]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/payment_plugin.html[Payment Plugin]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/payment_control_plugin.html[(Payment) Control Plugin]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/entitlement_plugin.html[Entitlement Plugin]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/invoice_plugin.html[Invoice Plugin]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/notification_plugin.html[Notification Plugin]

The next stage is to identify existing (similar) plugins which could be used as a starting point to write the code. At this point, this becomes a normal software development cycle, including writing unit tests for that plugin (independent of Kill Bill).

The rest of this document will explain how to setup and work with the `hello-world-plugin`. 

== Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have gone through the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/what_is_kill_bill.html[_What is Kill Bill_] document and are familiar with Kill Bill.
* Ensure that you have gone through the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/plugin_introduction.html[_Plugin Introduction_] document and are familiar with Kill Bill plugins.
* Ensure that you have *Maven 3.5.2* or higher (It can be downloaded from http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[_here_]).
* Ensure that you have *JDK 8* or higher (It can be downloaded from https://www.oracle.com/in/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html[_here_]).
* Ensure that *JAVA_HOME* environment variable is set to the path of your JDK installation (For example, if JDK is installed at *C:\Software\jdk1.8.0_102*, you need to set *JAVA_HOME* to *C:\Software\jdk1.8.0_102*).


== Getting Started

Let us now take a look at the steps involved in setting up the `hello world plugin`.

=== Setting up the Code in an IDE

The first step is to set up the plugin code in an IDE. For this, you need to do the following:

. Clone the `hello-world-plugin` repository from https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin[_Github_].

. Set up the code in the IDE of your choice. You can refer to our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/development.html#_setting_up_code_in_an_ide[__Development Document__] for detailed instructions on how to clone a repository and set up the code in Eclipse.

. This path where the repository is cloned will be referred to as *PROJECT_ROOT* from now on. For example, if you choose `C:/MyProjects/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin`, *PROJECT_ROOT* refers to this path. 

. Once the code is set up in Eclipse, your Eclipse workspace should look like this:
+
image::https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/plugin_development/eclipse_workspace_with_helloworldplugin.png[align=center]

[[build]]
=== Build

The `hello-world-plugin` is a standard Maven project. So you can build it as follows:

. Open a command prompt/terminal window and navigate to the *PROJECT_ROOT*  directory.

. Run the following command: 
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests
----
+
. Verify that a *BUILD SUCCESS* message is displayed on the console and that the plugin jar file 
is created as `PROJECT_ROOT/target/<artifact_id>-<version>.jar`.

[[deployment]]
=== Deployment

The `hello-world-plugin` can be deployed in an AWS, Docker or Tomcat Kill Bill installation as explained in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html[_Getting Started_] guide. However, if you are using the plugin as a basis to develop your own plugin, it would be useful to deploy the plugin in a https://docs.killbill.io/latest/development.html#_setting_up_kill_bill_in_your_development_environment[__standalone Kill Bill installation__]. Let us take a look at how to do this.

. Ensure that the Kill Bill application is configured and running in a Jetty server as explained https://docs.killbill.io/latest/development.html#_setting_up_kill_bill_in_your_development_environment[here]. 

. Ensure that you have *kpm* installed as per the instructions  https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/kpm[here].

. Open a command prompt/terminal window and run the following command to install the plugin (Replace `PROJECT_ROOT` with your actual project root, `<artifact_id>-<version>` with your JAR file name and  `path_to_install_plugin` with the actual path where you would like to install the plugin):
+
[source,bash]
----
kpm install_java_plugin 'dev:hello' --from-source-file=PROJECT_ROOT/target/<artifact_id>-<version>.jar --destination=<path_to_install_plugin>
----
+
. Verify that the `<artifact_id>-<version>.jar` is copied at the `path_to_install_plugin` path.

. Open `PROJECT_ROOT/profiles/killbill/src/main/resources/killbill-server.properties` and specify the following property (Replace `plugin_path` with the actual path where the plugin is installed. Note that if this property is not specified, Kill Bill looks for the plugin at the `/var/tmp/bundles/` path):
+
[source,properties]
----
org.killbill.osgi.bundle.install.dir=<plugin_path>
----
+
. Open a command prompt/terminal window and navigate to the *PROJECT_ROOT*  directory. Start Kill Bill by running the following command (Replace `PROJECT_ROOT` with your actual project root):
+
[source,bash]
----
 mvn -Dorg.killbill.server.properties=file:///PROJECT_ROOT/profiles/killbill/src/main/resources/killbill-server.properties -Dlogback.configurationFile=./profiles/killbill/src/main/resources/logback.xml jetty:run
----
+
. Verify that the following is displayed in the Kill Bill logs which confirms that the plugin is installed successfully:
+
[source,bash]
----
  GET /               [*/*]     [*/*]    (/HelloWorldServlet.hello)
  GET /healthcheck    [*/*]     [*/*]    (/HelloWorldHealthcheckServlet.check)
listening on:
  http://localhost:8080/plugins/hello-world-plugin/
----
+
. Open a browser and type \http://localhost:8080/plugins/hello-world-plugin/. If the plugin is installed properly, the following should be displayed in the Kill Bill logs:
+
[source,bash]
----
2020-12-09T04:58:15,750+0000 lvl='INFO', log='HelloWorldServlet', th='http-nio-8080-exec-1', xff='', rId='b79decfb-e809-4c01-9064-cff18722a67c', tok='', aRId='', tRId='', Hello world
----


== A Closer Look at Plugin Code

Let us now take a look at some of the important classes in the hello world plugin.

=== HelloWorldServlet

Plugins can export their own HTTP endpoints. The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldServlet.java[_HelloWorldServet_] provides an example of this. It exports the `plugins/hello-world-plugin/` endpoint. You can extend the `HelloWorldServlet` to add other endpoints as required.

A few pointers about the `HelloWorldServlet.hello` method (which provides the code for the `plugins/hello-world-plugin/` endpoint):

[source,java]
----
    @GET
    public void hello(@Local @Named("killbill_tenant") final Optional<Tenant> tenant) {
        // Find me on http://127.0.0.1:8080/plugins/hello-world-plugin
        logger.info("Hello world");
        if(tenant != null && tenant.isPresent() ) {
        	Tenant t1 = tenant.get();
        	logger.info("tenant id:"+t1.getId());
        	login();
        }
        else {
        	logger.info("tenant is not available");
        }
    }
----
* This method provides the code for the \http://localhost:8080/plugins/hello-world-plugin endpoint.

* It accepts a parameter corresponding to `Tenant` which is an `Optional`. 

* If the headers *X-Killbill-ApiKey / X-Killbill-ApiSecret* are set while accessing this endpoint as shown below, Kill Bill automatically injects a `Tenant` object into the servlet. 
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -v -u admin:password -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" "http://127.0.0.1:8080/plugins/hello-world-plugin"
----
+
* The `Tenant` object can then be used to retrieve tenant information like `tenantId` as demonstrated in the code above.

* If the headers *X-Killbill-ApiKey / X-Killbill-ApiSecret* are NOT set while accessing this endpoint as shown below, Kill Bill injects an empty `Optional` into the servlet.
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -v -u admin:password "http://127.0.0.1:8080/plugins/hello-world-plugin"
----

=== HelloWorldListener

The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldListener.java[_HelloWorldListener_] provides sample code for developing a notification plugin.  It listens to https://docs.killbill.io/latest/kill_bill_events.html[_Kill Bill events_] and takes actions. You can extend this class to handle other events as required. See the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/notification_plugin.html[_Notification Plugin Tutorial_] for further information.

=== HelloWorldPaymentPluginApi

The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldPaymentPluginApi.java[_HelloWorldPaymentPluginApi_] class provides sample code for developing a payment plugin. It implements the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/d9eca5af0e37541069b1c608f95e100dbe13b301/payment/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/payment/plugin/api/PaymentPluginApi.java[_PaymentPluginApi_] interface. You can extend this class as required to develop a payment plugin. See the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/payment_plugin.html[_Payment Plugin Tutorial_] for further information.

=== Other Classes

In addition to the classes listed above, some of the other classes in the `hello-world-plugin` are as follows:

* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldActivator.java[_HelloWorldActivator_]: While building a plugin, you need to create a class similar to `HelloWorldActivator`. You need to specify your plugin name here.
* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldConfigurationHandler.java[_HelloWorldConfigurationHandler_]: Most plugins require custom configuration. A configuration handler similar to the `HelloWorldConfigurationHandler` can be used to read the configuration properties.
* https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldHealthcheck.java[_HelloWorldHealthcheck_] and https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldHealthcheckServlet.java[_HelloWorldHealthcheckServlet_]: Can be used to provide the health status of the plugin.

== Enabling Per-tenant Configuration

As explained https://docs.killbill.io/latest/plugin_installation.html#per-tenant-configuration[_here_], Kill Bill supports per tenant configuration for plugins. In order enable per tenant configuration, the following needs to be done:

. Create a custom configuration handler similar to https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldConfigurationHandler.java[_HelloWorldConfigurationHandler_]

. Initialize it in the `start` method of your activator class as follows (see https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldActivator.java#L57[HelloWorldActivator.start]):
+
[source, java]
----
helloWorldConfigurationHandler = new HelloWorldConfigurationHandler(region, PLUGIN_NAME, killbillAPI);
final Properties globalConfiguration = helloWorldConfigurationHandler.createConfigurable(configProperties.getProperties());
helloWorldConfigurationHandler.setDefaultConfigurable(globalConfiguration);
----

Now, you can use the `ConfigurationHandler` to retrieve per-tenant properties. You can see an example of this in the <<retrieve_configuration_example, Authentication Steps>> section below.

== Setting Up a Breakpoint and Debugging

When you start developing your own plugin, it would be useful to be able to set up a break point and debug the plugin code. This section explains how you can achieve this. 

. Create a new environment variable *MAVEN_OPTS* and set it to `-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Djava.compiler=NONE -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n`.


. Open Eclipse and do the following:

.. Set up a break point in the HelloWorldServlet#L41.

.. Click *Run > Debug Configurations*.

.. Double-click  *New Remote Java Application*.

.. Enter the name that you would like to give to this debug configuration in the *Name* field.

.. Click *Apply*.

.. Click *Close*.

. Restart the Kill Bill application as explained in the <<deployment, "Deployment">> section above.

. Click `Run > Debug Configurations` and double click the  the Debug configuration that you created above.

. This runs the application in debug mode. You can also set additional breakpoints as required.

== Authentication Within Plugins

In order to invoke write API operations like `AccountUserApi#createAccount`, plugin code must authenticate against Kill Bill first. Otherwise, it will result in an `org.apache.shiro.authz.UnauthenticatedException`. This section explains how authentication can be done.

[[authentication_steps]]
=== Authentication Steps

In order to authenticate against Kill Bill, the following needs to be done:

. Configure the plugin with custom credentials - Although plugins can use the `admin/password` credentials for authentication, it is typically not advisable to do so. This is to limit the scope of operations that plugins can execute. It is thus recommended to _configure plugins with custom credentials_. (See https://docs.killbill.io/latest/plugin_installation.html#_per-tenant-configuration[__Per-tenant Plugin Configuration__]). So, you can configure the `hello-world-plugin` with custom credentials as follows:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl -v \
    -X POST \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
    -H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
   -d 'org.killbill.billing.plugin.hello-world.credentials.username=hello-world-user
org.killbill.billing.plugin.hello-world.credentials.password=hello-world-password' \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/uploadPluginConfig/hello-world-plugin"
----
+
[[retrieve_configuration_example]]
. Retrieve credentials in the code. For example, you can retrieve the credentials in the `HelloWorldListener` class as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
Properties properties = helloWorldConfigurationHandler.getConfigurable(killbillEvent.getTenantId());
final String username = properties.getProperty("org.killbill.billing.plugin.hello-world.credentials.username");
final String password = properties.getProperty("org.killbill.billing.plugin.hello-world.credentials.password");
----
+
. Invoke SecurityApi - Use the credentials obtained above to login as follows:
+
[source,java]
----
killbillAPI.getSecurityApi().login(login, password);
----
+
. Invoke the necessary write API method (The code below invokes the `accountUserApi.createAccount` method):
+
[source,java]
----
 osgiKillbillAPI.getAccountUserApi().createAccount(accountData, context);
----
+
. Invoke the `logout` method. This should typically be done within a `finally` clause:
+
[source,java]
----
osgiKillbillAPI.getSecurityApi().logout();
----

. You can also perform authentication within the `HelloWorldPaymentPluginApi` as well as `HelloWorldServlet`. Within the servlet, you will need to write code similar to the following:
+
[source,java]
----
private void login(final HttpServletRequest req) {
    String authHeader = req.getHeader("Authorization");
    if (authHeader == null) {
        return;
    }

    final String[] authHeaderChunks = authHeader.split(" ");
    if (authHeaderChunks.length < 2) {
        return;
    }

    try {
        final String credentials = new String(BaseEncoding.base64().decode(authHeaderChunks[1]), "UTF-8");
        int p = credentials.indexOf(":");
        if (p == -1) {
            return;
        }

        final String login = credentials.substring(0, p).trim();
        final String password = credentials.substring(p + 1).trim();
        killbillAPI.getSecurityApi().login(login, password);
    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException ignored) {
    }
}
----

=== Skipping Authentication

It is also possible to skip authentication in the plugin code. For this, the following needs to be done:

. Set the following property in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html#global_configuration_properties[Kill Bill config file]:

+
[source,bash]
----
org.killbill.security.skipAuthForPlugins=true
----
+
. Create a `PluginCallContext` class in your code similar to the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/8df47156a2e80c65ce574e0ad689afd02b926f59/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/setup/PluginCallContext.java[email notification plugin PluginCallContext] class.

+

. Create a `PluginCallContext` instance with `CallOrigin.INTERNAL` and `UserType.ADMIN` as follows:

+

[source,java]
----
final PluginCallContext callContext = new PluginCallContext(UUID.randomUUID(),pluginName, CallOrigin.INTERNAL,UserType.ADMIN,reasonCode,comments, createdDate,updatedDate,accountId, tenantId);
----
+
. Use the above `callContext` while invoking the desired api method:
+
[source,java]
----
accountUserApi.createAccount(accountData, callContext);
----

== Additional Notes

* We provide a https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-framework-java[Java plugin framework] that can be used to implement some of the work that plugins need to do - although your plugin does not have to rely on this framework, it is often a good idea to leverage it to avoid boilerplate code.

* Also, for internal reference, you might want to take a look at https://github.com/killbill/killbill-platform/blob/killbill-platform-0.36.2/osgi-bundles/libs/killbill/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/osgi/libs/killbill/KillbillActivatorBase.java#L59[KillbillActivatorBase], which provides all the abstractions that plugins require (access to java APIs, database connections, system properties, logging, ...).

== OSGi Configuration

As explained earlier, Kill Bill plugins are based on the OSGi standard. Let us now take a look at how this works and some additional OSGi configuration which may be required in some situations.

[NOTE]
*Note*: OSGi configuration is an advanced configuration option and may be required only in rare situations. So, feel free to skip this section.

=== Brief OSGi Overview

Let us first briefly understand how OSGi works. OSGi allows creating modular Java components (known as bundles) that run within an https://felix.apache.org/[_OSGi container_]. The OSGi container ensures that each bundle is isolated from other bundles. Thus, each bundle can use any external dependencies that it requires without having to worry about conflicts.

A bundle is nothing but a JAR file. However, its `manifest.mf` has some additional OSGi related headers.

Although each bundle is isolated from other bundles, sometimes bundles may need to communicate/share classes with other bundles. A bundle can export a package to make the corresponding classes available for use by other bundles. A bundle can also import a package to use the classes of another bundle.

For example if a bundle `bundle1` requires a class `p1.p2.A` from `bundle2`, `bundle2` needs to export the `p1.p2` package and `bundle1` needs to import this package. The packages imported by a bundle are specified as a `Import-package` header in the `manifest.mf` while packages exported by a bundle are specified as a `Export-package` header in the `manifest.mf`.

The OSGi container ensures that a given bundle's package dependencies can be satisfied before the bundle runs. Thus, if the package dependencies cannot be satisfied, the bundle will not run.

=== Kill Bill OSGi Overview

Before we dive into the details, let us understand at a high-level how the import-export mechanism works in case of the core Kill Bill system and its plugins. 

* The Kill Bill core itself is packaged as an OSGi bundle (referred to as system bundle). It exports several packages. This is explained in the <<packages_exported_by_killbill, "Packages exported by Kill Bill">> section. 

* A plugin automatically imports any packages exported by Kill Bill. This is explained in the <<packages_imported_by_plugins_by_default, "Packages Imported by Plugins by Default">> section. 

* However, in some cases, a plugin may need to explicitly import packages exported by Kill Bill. This is explained in the <<importing_additional_packages_in_plugins, "Importing Additional Packages in Plugins">> section.


[[packages_exported_by_killbill]]
=== Packages Exported by Kill Bill

As explained earlier, the Kill Bill system bundle exports the packages which it desires to share with plugins. Refer to the value of the `org.killbill.osgi.system.bundle.export.packages.api` property in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html#configuration_properties_table[__Kill Bill Configuration Properties Table__] to see the complete list of packages exported by default.

Additionally, Kill Bill also offers the `org.killbill.osgi.system.bundle.export.packages.extra` property which can be used to specify additional packages to be exported by the system bundle and that could in turn be imported by a plugin.  This property can be configured as explained in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[_Kill Bill configuration document_].

[[packages_imported_by_plugins_by_default]]
=== Packages Imported by Plugins by Default

As explained earlier, Kill Bill plugins are packaged as OSGi bundles. The http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-maven-bundle-plugin-bnd.html[_maven-bundle-plugin_] specified in the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/3aa938d19fdfba81c7c035b45c3f17cac74db177/pom.xml[_pom.xml_] is responsible for packaging a plugin as an OSGi bundle. Thus, the `maven-bundle-plugin` takes care of creating the jar with the correct OSGi headers (including adding the required packages to the `Import-Package` header). In addition, the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-oss-parent/blob/f3d9725cc7759a54eb6f978b3d3f763e1d170021/pom.xml[_killbill-oss-parent pom_] file (which is the parent of the plugin `pom.xml` file) also specifies the packages to be included in the `Import-Package` header.

Thus, when a plugin is built, the `Import-Package` header is automatically computed based on:

* Packages computed by the `maven-bundle-plugin`.
* Packages specified in the `killbill-oss-parent` pom file.

[[importing_additional_packages_in_plugins]]
=== Importing Additional Packages in Plugins

Sometimes, a plugin may require to use some additional packages from Kill Bill (other than those automatically imported as specified above). In such cases, you will need to explicitly *export* the package from Kill Bill and *import* it in the plugin as explained below.

. All the packages exported by Kill Bill by default are specified as the value of the `org.killbill.osgi.system.bundle.export.packages.api` property in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[__Kill Bill Configuration Properties Table__]. Check whether the desired package is already present in this list.

. If Kill Bill does not already export the package, add the following property in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[__Kill Bill configuration file__]: 
[source,bash]
org.killbill.osgi.system.bundle.export.packages.extra=<package1>,<package2>..<packagen>

. Open plugin `pom.xml` and specify the following in the `properties` section (Replace `<package>` with the fully qualified name of the package that you would like to export):
[source,xml]
 <osgi.extra-import>
            <package1>;
            <package2>;
            ....
            <packagen>
</osgi.extra-import> 

. <<build, Build>> the plugin using Maven as specified above.

This causes the package to be added to the `Import-Package` header of the plugin jar. You can see an example of this in the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-adyen-plugin/blob/0c5205d2ee42b543852e7cbd1a6f6f065ad575e5/pom.xml#L44[_Kill Bill Adyen Plugin pom file_]. 

=== Exporting Additional Packages from a Plugin

A plugin can also export packages corresponding to the classes that it wants to share with other plugins. This mechanism is particularly useful since it allows plugins to share custom functionality with other plugins. 

To *export* a package from a plugin, you need to follow the steps given below.

. Open plugin `pom.xml`. Specify the following in the `properties` section (Replace `<package>` with the fully qualified name of the package that you would like to export): 
[source,xml]
<osgi.export>
  <package1>,
  <package2>
   ....
  <packagen>
</osgi.export>

. <<build, Build>> the plugin using Maven as specified above.

This causes the specified packages to be added to the `Export-Package` header of the plugin jar. Other plugins can then use the classes in these packages by importing them as explained above.

In order to see an example of a plugin exporting packages, you can refer to the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin[_email notification plugin_]. It https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/819f4659825684131cf9a5f77b818d56dd86d163/pom.xml#L46[_exports_] packages required for creating a custom invoice formatter. The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-custom-invoice-formatter-example[_custom invoice formatter_] plugin (which is a sample plugin) then https://github.com/killbill/killbill-custom-invoice-formatter-example/blob/79e2f63cb536263f0272fdc9182e961f2616c5e3/pom.xml#L43[_imports_] these packages to customize the email invoice.


== FAQ

This section lists some common errors that are encountered while developing plugins and how you can fix them.

=== Authentication Error

Sometimes, you may see the `org.apache.shiro.authz.UnauthenticatedException: This subject is anonymous`. This occurs when your plugin code invokes any of the read/write Kill Bill operations without authenticating against Kill Bill. So, you first need to invoke `SecurityApi#login` API. See <<authentication_steps, "Authentication Steps">> section.

=== Maven Build Error

Sometimes, when you build the code using `mvn clean install` you may see some build errors as follows:

* Enforcer error:
+
[source,bash]
----
Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-enforcer-plugin:3.0.0-M3:enforce (default) on project killbill-plugin-momo: Some Enforcer rules have failed.

This generally occurs when your `pom.xml` contains dependencies that are not recommended. In such cases, we recommend that you fix the POM file and rerun the build, or run the build with the `-Dcheck.fail-enforcer=false` option.
+
* Spotbugs error: 
Kill Bill automatically performs `spotbugs` checks when running `mvn verify`. So, this may result in some https://spotbugs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bugDescriptions.html[spotbugs] errors.
+
In such cases, we recommend that you fix the spotbugs errors and rerun the build, or run the build with the `-Dcheck.fail-spotbugs=false` option.
+
* Other errors:
The build process has several checks in place to make sure the right dependencies are pulled in (for example, there are no duplicate dependencies, there are no obvious bugs, etc.). If you'd like to ignore all these checks and still proceed with the build, you can run the following command:
+
[source,bash]

=== java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError or java.lang.ClassNotFoundException

Sometimes, when you develop a custom plugin, a `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError` or a `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException` exception may occur on starting Kill Bill. This is most probably because the class in question is not present on the classpath. 

For a plugin to work, any classes used by the plugin must be present on the classpath. So, the class needs to be present in the *plugin jar* itself or it must be *imported* from Kill Bill. Refer to the <<importing_additional_packages_in_plugins, "Importing Additional Packages in Plugins">> section above for further details.

=== "Payment plugin xxx is not registered" Error

Sometimes, when you develop a custom payment plugin, you may see a `Payment plugin xxx is not registered` error. This is typically because the plugin is not registered as a payment plugin in your activator class. Ensure that it is registered as shown https://github.com/killbill/killbill-hello-world-java-plugin/blob/2dd9cbddb3f9e7a56cb4a217fcc12bc97c0795e2/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/helloworld/HelloWorldActivator.java#L70[here].
