= Tools for Analysis


== Overview

A variety of third-party tools are available to assist with application analysis functions such as performance monitoring and error tracking.
Several of these tools have been integrated with the AWS implementations of Kill Bill. This document identifies these integrations and provides some information you will need to put them to use. This discussion applies to the AWS single-tier and multi-tier implementations. The CloudFormation implementation is not discussed here because it is automatically bundled with CloudWatch.

== Check Your Kill Bill Version

To proceed, you should have a working Kill Bill implementation running on
AWS, using either the
https://docs.killbill.io/latest/aws-singletier.html[single-tier] or
https://docs.killbill.io/latest/aws-multitier.html[multi-tier]
installation options. The single-tier option runs Kill Bill, Kaui, the
MariaDB database, and the nginx load balancer on a single AWS EC2
instance. This is suitable for quick deployment and for testing and
development. The multi-tier option runs Kill Bill and Kaui on two or more
separate EC2 instances, and uses an AWS RDS database manager along with
an AWS load balancer. This is an attractive option for many production
uses.

You should be running Kill Bill version 2021.9 or later. This version
can be configured to provide metrics and error information to
each of the analysis tools discussed here. If you open the Kill Bill
admin page in your browser, it should show that you are
running the "Kill Bill Premium edition":

If you see this page you are ready to go. If not, you should upgrade
your installation.


== Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring enables you to analyze a variety of metrics that provide information on the operation of Kill Bill and Kaui along with the environment in which they run. Metrics can be graphed over time and collected in displays called Dashboards. Kill Bill collects over 1000 such metrics. AWS Kill Bill includes a framework for simple integration with the following performance monitoring tools:

* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/metrics-datadog.html[Datadog]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/metrics-newrelic.html[New Relic]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/metrics-cloudwatch.html[CloudWatch]

Datadog and New Relic offer similar analysis capabilities and can easily be integrated with the single-tier and multi-tier AWS implementations of Kill Bill. CloudWatch is an AWS service that is automatically included with CloudFormation implementations, and may be integrated with the other implementations as well.

== Error Tracking

Error Tracking is an important part of managing your Kill
Bill system. When warnings and errors are logged, whether due to system bugs or user mistakes, error tracking tools enable you to recognize and classify them, analyze what went wrong, fix the immediate problem, and develop ways to avoid similar errors in the future. AWS Kill Bill provides easy integration with the following error tracking tools:

* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/errors-rollbar.html[Rollbar]
* https://docs.killbill.io/latest/errors-sentry.html[Sentry]


== Getting Started

Integration of tools generally requires only two simple steps: Editing a few lines in a configuration file, and in some cases, installing an agent program using a simple command line script. For details on the installation of each specific tool, follow the links above.
