As the name implies, the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin[email notification plugin] is a plugin that sends out emails when certain events occur. This document covers how to install, test, and use this plugin.

== Prerequisites

Ensure that you have Kill Bill, Kaui, and the database set up as explained in the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/getting_started.html[Getting Started Guide].

== Overview 

The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin[email notification plugin] is a https://docs.killbill.io/latest/notification_plugin.html[notification plugin]. It listens to https://docs.killbill.io/latest/notification_plugin.html#_kill_bill_events_handled_by_notification_plugin[events] and sends emails accordingly.

Currently, the email notification plugin supports the following events:

[options="header",cols="1,1"]
|===
|Event Type   |Email Description
//-------------
|INVOICE_CREATION   |The customer will receive an email informing them that a new invoice is available.  
|INVOICE_NOTIFICATION   |The customer will receive an email about upcoming invoices (the time at which to send the email is configured through the Kill Bill system property `org.killbill.invoice.dryRunNotificationSchedule`).  
|INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS   |The customer will receive an email after each successful payment or refund.
|INVOICE_PAYMENT_FAILED   |The customer will receive an email after each failed payment.  
|SUBSCRIPTION_CANCEL   | The customer will receive an email at the time a subscription was requested to be canceled and/or at the effective date of the subscription cancellation.  
|===

To send an email the following is required:

* The tenant or account must be configured to permit such event(s). This is explained in the <<Plugin Configuration>> section below.

* The account for which the emails need to be sent must have certain fields set. This is explained in the <<Account Configuration>> section below.



== Plugin Installation

A plugin can be installed via the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/blob/master/kpm[Kill Bill Package Manager (KPM)]. For this, please follow the steps given below:

. Ensure that you have kpm installed as explained https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/kpm#kpm-installation[here].

. Install the plugin using the following kpm command (Replace `<path_to_install_plugin>` with the path where you want to install the plugin. This path should match the path specified by the `org.killbill.osgi.bundle.install.dir` property in the Kill Bill configuration file):
[source,bash]
kpm install_java_plugin email-notifications --destination=<path_to_install_plugin>

. Verify that the plugin is installed properly. This can be done by ensuring that the plugin JAR is present at the `path_to_install_plugin` specified in the previous step. Alternatively, you can also open `kpm` in https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_kaui.html[Kaui] and verify that the email notification plugin is running as follows:
image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/email-notification-plugin/kaui_email_notification_plugin.png[align=center]

. If you would like to make changes to the plugin, you can clone the plugin code, build and deploy it as explained https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin[here].


== Database Configuration

The email-notification-plugin requires some additional database tables. To create these tables, please follow the steps given below:

. Connect to the Kill Bill database.

. Run the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/ddl.sql[email-notification-plugin] DDL.

== Plugin Configuration

In order to use the email notification plugin, a tenant needs to be configured with the SMTP properties required for sending emails. Additionally, the tenant can also be configured with the events for which emails should be sent. In addition to the per-tenant configuration, the plugin also allows a more granular account-level configuration for the set of emails to be sent for the particular account. Thus, either the tenant or the account needs to be configured with the events for which the email needs to be sent.

The tenant/account configuration can be done by executing the required API endpoints via *cURL* as explained below:

[[tenant-config,Tenant Configuration]]
. *Configure the tenant* using the following cURL command (Replace `<events>` with a comma-separated list of the events for which the emails need to be sent. For example, to configure the tenant to send emails for *INVOICE_CREATION* and *INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS*, specify `org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.defaultEvents=INVOICE_CREATION,INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS`):
[source,bash]
curl -v \
     -X POST \
     -u admin:password \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: admin' \
     -H 'Content-Type: text/plain' \
     -d 'org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.defaultEvents=<events>
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.host=127.0.0.1
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.port=25
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.useAuthentication=true
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.userName=uuuuuu
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.password=zzzzzz
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.useSSL=false
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.sendHTMLEmail=true
org.killbill.billing.plugin.email-notifications.smtp.defaultSender=xxx@yyy.com' \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/uploadPluginConfig/killbill-email-notifications
     
. If you are on Windows, we recommend that you use https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git Bash] to run the above command. Since the above is a multiline cURL command, it may not run properly in the standard windows command prompt. Alternatively, you may also use https://www.postman.com/[Postman] to execute the tenant configuration endpoint as explained https://docs.killbill.io/latest/postman.html[here].

. *Configure the account* using the following cURL command (Replace `{accountId}` with the id of the account for which emails need to be sent and `<events>` with a comma-separated list of the events for which the emails need to be sent. For example, to configure the account to send emails for *INVOICE_CREATION* and *INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS*, specify `"INVOICE_CREATION", "INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS"`):
[source,bash]
curl -v \
     -X POST \
     -u admin:password \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar' \
     -H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: admin' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '[<events>]' \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/plugins/killbill-email-notifications/v1/accounts/{accountId}
   
. Note that either the *tenant* or the *account* should be configured with the events for which emails need to be sent, otherwise, emails will not be sent. Some scenarios for this:

.. If a tenant is configured with some events, but the account is not configured, then emails will be sent based on what is configured at the tenant level.

.. If a tenant is not configured with any events but the account is configured with events, then emails will be sent based on what is configured at the account level.

.. If both tenant and account are configured with separate events, emails will be sent based on the events configured for both.

== Account Configuration

The account for which emails need to be sent, needs to have the `email` and `locale` fields set. In addition, the <<email-templates>> used by the notification plugin also require the  `company`, `address1`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country` fields also set on the Account.

Thus, ensure that the account is created using the following cURL command (Replace `<email_id>` with the email id where you would like to receive the email and change values for the other fields as required):
[source, bash]
curl -v \
    -X POST \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
    -d '{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "<email_id>", "currency": "USD", "company": "Acme Corporation", "locale":"en_US", "address1": "57 Academy Drive","city": "Oak Creek","state": "WI","postalCode": "53154", "country": "US"}' \
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/accounts"


== SMTP Server Notes

In order to be able to use the email notification plugin to send emails, a local SMTP server is required. 



We typically use the `namshi/smtp` docker image as follows to start a local SMTP server on port 25:

[source, bash]
docker run -tid --name smtp_server -p 25:25  -e DISABLE_IPV6=true namshi/smtp

Alternatively, if you would like to use a non-docker based SMTP server, you can use https://www.mailslurper.com/[MailSlurper]. MailSlurper is a small handy SMTP server that can be useful for development. It can be downloaded and configured as explained https://www.mailslurper.com/[here].


== Testing the plugin

Once the plugin is installed and configured as explained above, it can be used for sending emails. You can verify that the plugin is working correctly by following the steps given below:

. Start a local SMTP server as explained in the <<SMTP Server Notes>> section above.

. Create a tenant as follows (specify the required `apiKey` and `apiSecret`):
[source,bash]
curl -v \
    -X POST \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
    -d '{ "apiKey": "bob", "apiSecret": "lazar"}' \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants"

. Configure the tenant as specified in the <<tenant-config>> section above with *INVOICE_CREATION* and *INVOICE_PAYMENT_SUCCESS* events.

. Create an account as follows (Replace `<email_id>` with the email id where you would like to receive the email and change values for the other fields as required):
[source, bash]
curl -v \
    -X POST \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
    -d '{ "name": "John Doe", "email": "<email_id>", "currency": "USD", "company": "Acme Corporation", "locale":"en_US", "address1": "57 Academy Drive","city": "Oak Creek","state": "WI","postalCode": "53154", "country": "US"}' \
"http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/accounts"

. If successful, the command above returns a `Location` header like \http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/accounts/eda3e357-20a1-456d-a9b3-b39ca3db8020. Copy the `account_id` in the header (`eda3e357-20a1-456d-a9b3-b39ca3db8020` in this case) and save it for future use.

. Add a payment method as follows (replace `<account_id>` with the account id obtained above):
[source, bash]
curl -v \
    -X POST \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
    -d '{ "accountId": "<account_id>", "pluginName": "__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__"}' \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/accounts/<account_id>/paymentMethods"
   
. If successful, the command above returns a `Location` header like
\http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/paymentMethods/c2ff0040-7c5b-48bf-9685-a4c57501535f. Copy the `payment_method_id` in the header (`c2ff0040-7c5b-48bf-9685-a4c57501535f` in this case) and save it for future use.

. Set the payment method as default as follows (replace `<account_id>` and `<payment_method_id>` with the values obtained above):
[source,bash]
curl -v \
    -X PUT \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/accounts/<account_id>/paymentMethods/<payment_method_id>/setDefault"

. Create a external charge to trigger an invoice as follows(replace `<account_id>` with the account_id obtained above):
[source,bash]
curl -v \
    -X POST \
    -u admin:password \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
    -H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "X-Killbill-CreatedBy: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Reason: demo" \
    -H "X-Killbill-Comment: demo" \
    -d '[ { "accountId": "<account_id>", "description": "My charge", "amount": 50, "currency": "USD" }]'    \
    "http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/invoices/charges/<account_id>?autoCommit=true"

. Confirm that an email is sent for the invoice and successful payment.

Note that you can also use https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_kaui.html[Kaui] for executing steps 2-9 above.

   
== Template and resource configuration  

The email notification plugin uses https://mustache.github.io/[Mustache] templates for generating emails. This section explains how custom email templates can be configured.

[[email-templates,default email templates]]
=== Templates Overview

An email template contains the body of an email. In addition to static text, it contains some variables which are replaced at runtime by the https://mustache.github.io/[mustache] engine.

The email notification plugin comes with some https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/tree/master/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/templates[default templates]. However, users can also upload their custom templates.

The email notification plugin uses *one template per locale and per type* (as opposed to one template per type with an additional set of translation string bundles for each locale). So, for example, the *INVOICE_CREATION* event can have templates like `INVOICE_CREATION_en_US`, `INVOICE_CREATION_fr_FR`, and so on. When an *INVOICE CREATION* email needs to be sent for a user, the user's `locale` is checked and the corresponding template is used. The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/tree/master/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/templates[default templates] are available only for the *en_US* locale, however, users can upload templates for other locales if required.


=== Resources overview

In addition to templates, the email notification plugin requires a resource file. This resource file contains *key-value pairs* which can be used to replace variables in a template. The email notification plugin comes with a https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/tree/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/translations[default resource file] that contains key-value pairs for the variables in the default templates.

Unlike email templates, all the events have a single resource file. However, different locales can have different resource files. This allows having string translations in different languages, (like different translations for the catalog product names). So for example, you can have different resource files like `Translation_en_US.properties`, `Translation_fr_FR.properties`, and so on. When an email needs to be sent for a user, the user's `locale` is checked and the corresponding resource file is used to replace the variables in the template.

The https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/translations/Translation_en_US.properties[default resource file] is available only for the *en_US* locale. Users can add additional key-value pairs to this resource file as well as add new resource files for different locales.  

=== Template/Translation Resource Keys

Each email template and the translation resource is assigned a *key*. To upload a custom email template/translation resource, its key needs to be specified.

The following table provides details about the template/translation resource keys (assuming that the locale is `en_US`):

[options="header",cols="1,1,1,1"]

|===

=== Uploading a custom template

As explained earlier, you can upload per-tenant email templates for various events. Let's look at an example to upload a template for the next upcoming invoice for a locale `en_US`:

. Create the template `/tmp/UpcomingInvoice.mustache`:
+
``` bash
*** You Have a New Invoice ***

You have a new invoice from {{text.merchantName}}, due on {{invoice.targetDate}}.

{{#invoice.invoiceItems}}
{{startDate}} {{planName}} : {{invoice.formattedAmount}}
{{/invoice.invoiceItems}}

{{text.invoiceAmountTotal}}: {{invoice.formattedBalance}}

{{text.billedTo}}:
{{account.companyName}}
{{account.name}}
{{account.address1}}
{{account.city}}, {{account.stateOrProvince}} {{account.postalCode}}
{{account.country}}

If you have any questions about your account, please reply to this email or contact {{text.merchantName}} Support at: {{text.merchantContactPhone}}
```

. Upload the template for your tenant:
[source, bash]
curl -v \
-u admin:password \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
-H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: admin' \
-H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
-X POST \
--data-binary @/tmp/UpcomingInvoice.mustache \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/userKeyValue/killbill-email-notifications:UPCOMING_INVOICE_en_US

. If your template uses some additional keys than what are specified in the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/translations/Translation_en_US.properties[default translation file], these need to be added to the translation file as explained in the next section.

=== Uploading Resource files

As explained earlier, you can upload additional resource files for different locales or additional keys in existing resource files. In order to do this, please follow the steps given below:

. Check if a resource file https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/translations/[already exists] for your locale. If so, download the file and if not, create a new file. You can use the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/resources/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/translations/Translation_en_US.properties[default translation template] as a reference to create a new file.

. Add the required properties (key-value pairs) to your file.

. Upload the new resource file using the following cURL command (Replace `<template-name>` with the name of the file created in the previous step and `<translation_key>` with the translation key. For example the translation key for a resource file for the `en_US` locale will be *TEMPLATE_TRANSLATION_en_US*):
[source, bash]
curl -v \
-u admin:password \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiKey: bob" \
-H "X-Killbill-ApiSecret: lazar" \
-H 'X-Killbill-CreatedBy: admin' \
-H "Content-Type: text/plain" \
-X POST \
--data-binary @/<template-name>.properties \
http://127.0.0.1:8080/1.0/kb/tenants/userKeyValue/killbill-email-notifications:<translation_key>

== Configuring the plugin for additional events

As explained earlier, the email notification plugin is a https://docs.killbill.io/latest/notification_plugin.html[notification plugin]. In addition to the events handled by it by default, it can be configured to listen to other events and send emails accordingly. 

In order to configure the plugin to send emails for other events, you will need to modify the plugin code as follows:

. Ensure that the event for which you would like to send an email is defined in the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-plugin-api/blob/d9eca5af0e37541069b1c608f95e100dbe13b301/notification/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/notification/plugin/api/ExtBusEventType.java[ExtBusEventType.java].

. Modify the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/setup/EmailNotificationListener.java[EmailNotificationListener] class as follows:

.. Modify the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/setup/EmailNotificationListener.java#L113[EmailNotificationListener#handleKillbillEvent] method to add case statements corresponding to the events that need to be handled.

.. Add a method corresponding to the email that you would like to send similar to the https://github.com/killbill/killbill-email-notifications-plugin/blob/6fc76403233fd5be290841ee6fc9d728028892f0/src/main/java/org/killbill/billing/plugin/notification/setup/EmailNotificationListener.java#L213[EmailNotificationListener#sendEmailForUpComingInvoice] method.

. Upload email templates and translation resource file corresponding to the email that you would like to send as explained in the <<Template and resource configuration>> section.

== Troubleshooting

This section covers some common issues and their solutions.

=== Emails not sent

Sometimes, even after configuring the plugin as mentioned above, you may find that emails are not sent. There are several reasons for this:

*Missing information on Account*

In order to send an email, the `Account` record needs to have
the `locale` and `email` fields set. In addition, if you are using the default templates provided by the plugin, the `company`, `address1`, `city`, `state`, `postalCode`, `country` fields also need to be set on the Account. If any of these fields are missing, emails will not be sent and you will see the following exception in the Kill Bill logs:

[source,bash]
com.samskivert.mustache.MustacheException: No key, method or field with name 'account.companyName'

Ensure that the account for which the emails are to be sent is configured with all the required fields as explained in the <<Account Configuration>> section above.

*Missing information in template*

Sometimes, you may upload a custom template. However, you may forget to upload the translation keys for it in the resource file. In such a case, the email will not be sent and you will see the following exception in the Kill Bill logs:
