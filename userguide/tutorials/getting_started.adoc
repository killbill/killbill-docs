= Getting Started

This document explains what you need to get started using Kill Bill in your chosen environment. The first step is installing Kill Bill itself and the Kaui administrative console, along with their required database, in the environment you will be using.

== Installation

There are several different ways to get Kill Bill and Kaui up and running. The packages can be installed on your local computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) or on a Linux server in the cloud. The three principal options are:

1. Use our one-click installer to install the programs using a ready-to-run container on a fresh AWS Ubuntu instance that you provide
2. Install Docker on your local machine or a new or existing cloud server instance. Then install Kill Bill and Kaui in a Docker container.
3. Install Kill Bill and Kaui, together with a MySQL database, directly on an Apache Tomcat server in your chosen environment.

These options are discussed in the remainder of this document.

=== AWS (One-Click)

If you prefer to run Kill Bill on a cloud server, and are familiar with AWS, this is the easiest and fastest way to get started. Just try out our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/aws.html[One-Click installer]. 

=== Docker

You can run Kill Bill locally or in the cloud using our official Docker images. These require the installation of Docker and Docker Compose. Docker Compose is used to setup and manage the three separate Docker containers required by Kill Bill: One each for Kill Bill itself, for Kaui, and for the shared SQL database engine.

The principal steps in the installation are:

1. Make sure that the required versions of Docker and Docker Compose are installed in your chosen environment.
2. Prepare a YAML file to control the loading of KillBill and the other necessary packages using Docker Compose.
3. Run Docker Compose to launch the packages in the web server.

If you are working with Mac or Windows, take a look at the https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Get Started with Docker] guide. This will describe the procedures for setting up and testing Docker in a Mac or Windows environment using Docker Desktop. It is quite easy to get it up and running. This approach will greatly simplify the Kill Bill stack setup, as Tomcat and MySQL configuration will be done for you.
If you cannot use Docker Desktop, you may still be able to install Docker with older methods using Docker Toolbox. For details see https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_mac/[Install Docker Toolbox on MacOS] or https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/[Install Docker Toolbox on Windows].

If you are using a Linux environment, read the appropriate sections of the https://docs.docker.com/install/[Docker Engine Overview].

If you are not using Docker Desktop, proceed with the steps below. The rest of the discussion assumes you are working with a command line interface (CLI) on Mac, Windows, or Linux. On Mac open the Terminal application, or on Windows use the Command window.

Your Linux flavor is assumed to be Ubuntu, either on a local machine or on an AWS instance. Our http://killbill.io/blog/tag/docker/[blog] has tips on how to deploy to other popular cloud providers. If you are using a different Linux flavor, you may have to adapt some of the commands. 

To check whether Docker and Docker Compose are already installed, and what versions you have, open a command (or terminal) window and type the following commands:

   docker --version
   docker-compose --version
   

The versions that we are expecting for this discussion are:

* Docker: 19.03.6 or higher
* Docker Compose: 1.25.4 or higher


If Docker or Docker Compose are not installed, on a Mac, one option is to try to install them using Homebrew:

[source,bash]
----
brew install docker docker-compose
----

This may require that the free package Homebrew be installed first. See https://osxdaily.com/2018/03/07/how-install-homebrew-mac-os/[How to install Homebrew on Mac].

On Ubuntu we can use the following commands to install Docker:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker virtualbox
----
We have *not* installed Docker Compose in these commands, because the Ubuntu archive is not guaranteed to provide the latest version. Instead you should use the command

[source,bash]
----
sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
----

This command should be set to load the latest stable release. For information on releases see the https://github.com/docker/compose/releases[releases page].

The next step is to create a YAML file called docker-compose.yml, similar to the one below. The version of the file shown is 3.2, which works with Docker 17.04.0 or higher. For information on compose file formats see https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-versioning/[compose file formats]

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.2'
volumes:
  db:
services:
  killbill:
    image: killbill/killbill:0.22.12
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - KILLBILL_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/killbill
      - KILLBILL_DAO_USER=root
      - KILLBILL_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
      - KILLBILL_CATALOG_URI=SpyCarAdvanced.xml
  kaui:
    image: killbill/kaui:2.0.5
    ports:
      - "9090:8080"
    environment:
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/kaui
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_USER=root
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
      - KAUI_KILLBILL_URL=http://killbill:8080
  db:
    image: killbill/mariadb:0.22
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: db
        target: /var/lib/mysql
    expose:
      - "3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=killbill
----

Now place this file in your current directory and run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

If all goes well 3 containers will start:

* one for MariaDB (shared database, used by both Kill Bill and Kaui)
* one for Kill Bill (accessible on port 8080)
* one for Kaui (accessible on port 9090)

The startup sequence lasts a couple of minutes. It is ready when you see the message "INFO: Server startup". If it takes a long time or if the container crashes, verify you have enough memory allocated to Docker. On a Mac for instance, go to Docker Desktop Preferences and set the Memory to 4GiB in the Advanced panel. On Ubuntu, be sure you have at least 4GiB of RAM.

You should now be able to log-in to Kaui by going to http://<IP>:9090. If Docker is running on your local machine, <IP> is 127.0.0.1. Otherwise, it is the IP of your server.

You will be presented with a login page. Default credentials are:

* username: admin
* password: password

You can also go to http://<IP>:8080/api.html to explore the KillBill APIs.

=== Tomcat

Users familiar with Java technologies can also install Kill Bill directly in their Web container of choice, such as Tomcat. We recommend using Tomcat version 8.5.



If you don't have it yet, you can download the Tomcat container http://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi[here] (get the Core binary distribution). The documentation is available http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/index.html[here].

In the rest of this guide, we will assume you have installed Tomcat in a directory called *CATALINA_HOME*.

Notes:

* Unlike other installation methods, you will also need to install and configure your database manually. See https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_deployment.html#_database_engine[our deployment guide] for more details.
* Installation on Windows might work, but isn't tested nor recommended by the core team.
* We recommend installing the https://tomcat.apache.org/native-doc/[Apache Tomcat Native Library] (automatically done for you when using Ansible, Docker, or in our Cloud Marketplace instances).

==== Tomcat configuration

Recommended Tomcat configuration files can be found https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/tree/master/ansible/templates/tomcat/conf[here]. The `.j2` extension is for the Jinja templating language: you must render the files first using your custom variables, which depend on your environment (take a look at an example of such variables https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/blob/master/ansible/group_vars/all.yml[here]). https://ansible.sivel.net/test/[This website] can be used to perform the rendering online if you do not have Jinja installed.

Once rendered, `setenv2.sh` should be placed in *CATALINA_HOME/bin* and all other files should be placed in *CATALINA_HOME/conf*.

Using these default configuration files, Tomcat will start on port 8080, which should be the only port open for ingress traffic in production (egress traffic should not be restricted).

==== Kill Bill

The Kill Bill configuration properties need to be added at the end of the file *CATALINA_HOME/conf/catalina.properties*. The minimal set of system properties required is the ones for the jdbc parameters (refer to our http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[configuration guide] for more details). For example (update the values as needed):

[source,java]
----
org.killbill.dao.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/killbill
org.killbill.dao.user=killbill
org.killbill.dao.password=killbill
org.killbill.billing.osgi.dao.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/killbill
org.killbill.billing.osgi.dao.user=killbill
org.killbill.billing.osgi.dao.password=killbill
logback.configurationFile=/var/lib/killbill/config/logback.xml
----

Place the logging configuration file https://github.com/killbill/killbill-cloud/blob/master/ansible/templates/killbill/logback.xml.j2[logback.xml] as `/var/lib/killbill/config/logback.xml` (refer to the Jinja templating language instructions above).

Download the current stable version of the Kill Bill war from https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:killbill-profiles-killbill[Maven Central] (make sure to download the `killbill-profiles-killbill-X.Y.Z.war` file and not the `jetty-console.war`, `jar-with-dependencies.war` or `jar-with-dependencies-sources.war` one) and place it under *CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT.war* (delete the directory *CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT* if it exists).

Once this is setup, you can start the Tomcat container using the script *CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh*. The server will be started in the background but logs can be followed at *CATALINA_HOME/logs/catalina.out*.

==== Kaui

You can follow similar steps for the installation of Kaui.

Setup the system properties as follows:

[source,java]
----
kaui.url=http://127.0.0.1:8080
kaui.db.url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:3306/kaui
kaui.db.username=killbill
kaui.db.password=killbill
----

And download the current version of the Kaui war from https://search.maven.org/search?q=a:kaui-standalone[Maven Central].

== Getting Started without code (Kaui)

Go to http://127.0.0.1:9090[http://127.0.0.1:9090]. You will be prompted for a username and password. Both Kill Bill and Kaui support role based access control (RBAC), where you can configure fine-grained permissions for your users. The default set of credentials is `admin`/`password`, which grants full access.

Because Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy (where each tenant has its own data, configuration, etc.), the next step is to create your own tenant. We will assume the api key is `bob` and api secret `lazar` in the rest of this guide.

=== Modifying the Catalog

The Kill Bill *catalog* contains products and plans definitions. This XML configuration file is really powerful and offers various options for handling trials, add-ons, upgrades/downgrades, etc. For more details on its features, read the http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[Subscription Billing manual].

For basic use cases, Kaui also lets you configure *simple* (subset of what is supported through XML configuration) plans through the UI, so you don't have to generate the catalog XML manually. This is available on your tenant configuration page, that you can access by clicking on your tenant name at the top right corner of every Kaui page.

For this tutorial, create 2 plans: *standard-free* (free plan) and *standard-monthly* (premium plan), associated with a single `Standard` product (the product category is `BASE`). We could have just defined standard-monthly, but that way you could make free users subscribe to the free plan. This is useful for reporting for example (to track how long it took to upsell them, etc.)

Note that we haven't defined any trial period.

image:https://github.com/killbill/killbill-docs/raw/v3/userguide/assets/img/tutorials/multi_gateways_catalog_kaui.png[align=center]

=== Creating Your First Account

We will assume that users going to your site have to create an account in your system. When they do, you will need to create a mirrored *account* in Kill Bill.

To do so in Kaui, click the CREATE NEW ACCOUNT link at the top of the page.

Notes:

* The Kill Bill *External key* field should map to the unique id of the account in your system (should be unique and immutable). Kill Bill will auto-generate an id if you don't populate this field
* There are many more fields you can store (phone number, address, etc.) -- all of them are optional. Keep local regulations in mind though when populating these (PII laws, GDPR, etc.).

=== Adding a Payment Method

To trigger payments, Kill Bill will need to integrate with a payment provider (such as Stripe or PayPal). Each means of payment (e.g. a credit card) will have a *payment method* associated with it.

For simplicity in this tutorial, we will assume your customers send you checks. To create the payment method in Kaui, click the + next to Payment Methods on the main account page. The plugin name should be set to $$__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__$$, leave all other fields blank and make sure the checkbox Default Payment Method is checked.

Once you are ready to integrate with a real payment processor, all you'll have to do is to create a new payment method for that account. The rest of this tutorial will still apply.

=== Creating Your First Subscription

Let's now try to subscribe a user to the Standard plan. This is the call that would need to be triggered from your website, when the user chooses the premium plan on the subscription checkout page.

In Kaui, click the Subscriptions tab then the + by *Subscription Bundles* (a subscription bundle is a collection, a _bundle_, of subscriptions, containing one base subscription and zero or more add-ons). Select the `standard-monthly` plan in the dropdown. You can also specify an optional (but unique) key to identify this subscription.

Because there is no trial period and because billing is performed in advance by default, Kill Bill will have automatically billed the user for the first month.

You should see the invoice and the payment by clicking on the Invoices and Payments tabs.

Kill Bill will now automatically charge the user on a monthly basis. You can estimate the amount which will be billed at a future date by triggering a dry-run invoice. On the main account page, in the Billing Info section, click the *Trigger invoice generation* wand (specify a date at least a month in the future).

== Getting Started with code (API Client)

Now that you are familiar with the basics, the next step is to integrate Kill Bill in your application using our APIs. Our https://killbill.github.io/slate/[API documentation] contains snippets to help you get started.

> Note: This section assumes you are already familiar with the core concepts of Kill Bill. If you aren't, make sure to go back to the previous section first.
