== Introduction

Kill Bill is the open-source subscription billing and payments platform.

The *subscription billing* features let you create recurring or usage based subscriptions (e.g. "gold plan subscription at $9.99/month") and manage upgrades and downgrades. The system will take care of generating invoices, managing credits and triggering payments. Netflix, Dropbox and The New York Times are examples of websites which sell such subscriptions.

The *payment* features let you connect with virtually any payment gateway and processor (Stripe, Braintree, PayPal, Adyen, CyberSource, etc.) to charge your customers (using credit or debit cards, ACH, wire transfers, Bitcoin, etc.) for their subscriptions or one-off payments (e.g. shopping cart-type websites like Amazon or Zappos).

We refer to Kill Bill as a *platform* because of its extensibility: you can write plugins to modify the behavior of the system or to integrate with third-party vendors, such as fraud detection solutions (Accertify, Feedzai, etc.) or Tax providers (Avalara AvaTax, etc.). A lot of open-source plugins are available on our http://github.com/killbill/killbill[GitHub organization].

Kill Bill is a standalone Java server that runs in your back-end. Your customers will never interact with it directly, instead your website (it could be a custom e-commerce website, a Drupal or WordPress deployment, etc.) will trigger REST API calls (over HTTP) to process subscriptions or orders. We also provide *Kaui*, the Kill Bill administrative UI, an interface to interact with Kill Bill for your support and finance teams (to manage refunds, invoice adjustments, etc.).

Conceptually, Kill Bill is deployed as such:

* Customers interact with your custom e-commerce website (in blue), which issues REST API calls to Kill Bill. You are responsible for designing and building that piece
* Kill Bill (in pink), with its database, manages subscriptions, invoices, payments, etc.
* Kill Bill interacts with third-party services (in green), such as payment processors like Stripe and PayPal. You are responsible for choosing and signing contracts with these services

=== The Kill Bill platform

Some of the features of the Kill Bill platform include:

* Core Foundations
** High level of integrity and *robustness*
** Authentication and role-based access control (*RBAC*) support integrating with your LDAP, Okta, etc.
** A *plugin framework* where open-source and proprietary plugins can be added to modify the behavior of the system, and/or to interact with third party systems
** A robust persistent *event bus*, that is used both internally and externally (events are visible to plugins and to other services via HTTP push notifications)
** An *auditing* framework that keeps track of all the changes that occurred (who?, when?, what?)
* Core services, each of which exposing its own APIs and publishing bus events, which are consumed by other core services or plugins:
** Account
** Catalog
** Subscription and entitlement
** Usage: units recording from metering system
** Invoice: invoice generation and management (e.g. ability to adjust invoice items) for subscriptions and one-off charges
** Payment: payment gateways integration for recurring and one-off payments
** Overdue: dunning management (in case of unpaid invoices for instance)
* Plugins

Contrary to most (SaaS) billing solutions, Kill Bill is *not* a batch oriented system, but instead, it is driven by events occurring in the system (for example, the creation of a new subscription will create a new event that the invoicing core service will process and as result a new invoice may be created along with a new event, which the payment core service will then process, ...).

Kill Bill is packaged as a WAR and is therefore executed within a web container (typically Tomcat). It offers https://killbill.github.io/slate/[REST APIs] to manage the state associated with accounts, subscriptions, invoices, payments, ...

Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy, meaning you can run multiple logical instances of Kill Bill with a single server and database (see this http://killbill.io/blog/subscription-service-using-kill-bill[blog post] which illustrates some of the use cases).

== Installation

Docker is the recommended way to run Kill Bill, both for developers and in production.

If you are not yet familiar with Docker, take a look at the https://docs.docker.com/get-started/[Get Started with Docker] guide. It is quite easy to get it up and running, and will greatly simplify the Kill Bill stack setup.

Assuming docker, docker-machine and docker-compose are https://docs.docker.com/install/[installed], the first step is to create a machine to run your containers. On a Mac, you would typically use the virtualbox driver:

[source,bash]
----
docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory "2048" killbill
eval $(docker-machine env killbill)
----

Retrieve the IP address of the Docker machine via:

[source,bash]
----
docker-machine ip killbill
----

We will assume it's 192.168.99.100 in the rest of this guide.

Next, create a docker-compose.yml file similar to the one below (replace `ENV_HOST_IP` with your Docker machine IP address):

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.2'
volumes:
  db:
services:
  killbill:
    image: killbill/killbill:0.20.0
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8000:8000"
      - "12345:12345"
    environment:
      - KILLBILL_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/killbill
      - KILLBILL_DAO_USER=root
      - KILLBILL_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
      - ENV_HOST_IP=192.168.99.100
  kaui:
    image: killbill/kaui:1.0.4
    ports:
      - "9090:8080"
    environment:
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_URL=jdbc:mysql://db:3306/kaui
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_USER=root
      - KAUI_CONFIG_DAO_PASSWORD=killbill
      - KAUI_KILLBILL_URL=http://killbill:8080
  db:
    image: killbill/mariadb:0.20
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: db
        target: /var/lib/mysql
    expose:
      - "3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=killbill
----

and run:

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up
----

3 containers will start:

* one for MariaDB (shared database, used by both Kill Bill and Kaui)
* one for Kill Bill (accessible on port 8080)
* one for Kaui (accessible on port 9090)

The startup sequence lasts a few minutes. It is ready when you see the message "Kill Bill server has started".

You can log-in to Kaui by going to http://192.168.99.100:9090 (replace with your Docker machine IP address as needed). Default credentials are:

* username: admin
* password: password

You can also go to http://192.168.99.100:8080/api.html to explore our APIs.

== Using Kill Bill with Kaui

Go to http://192.168.99.100:9090[http://192.168.99.100:9090] (update the IP address as needed). You will be prompted for a username and password. Both Kill Bill and Kaui support role based access control (RBAC), where you can configure fine-grained permissions for your users. The default set of credentials is `admin`/`password`, which grants full access.

Because Kill Bill supports multi-tenancy (where each tenant has its own data, configuration, etc.), the next step is to create your own tenant. We will assume the api key is `bob` and api secret `lazar` in the rest of this guide.

=== Modifying the catalog

The Kill Bill *catalog* contains products and plans definitions. This XML configuration file is really powerful and offers various options for handling trials, add-ons, upgrades/downgrades, etc. For more details on its features, read the http://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_subscription.html[Subscription Billing manual].

For basic use cases, Kaui also lets you configure *simple* (subset of what is supported through XML configuration) plans through the UI, so you don't have to generate the catalog XML manually. This is available on your tenant configuration page, that you can access by clicking on your tenant name at the top right corner of every Kaui page.

For this tutorial, create 2 plans: *standard-free* (free plan) and *standard-monthly* (premium plan), associated with a single `Standard` product (the product category is `BASE`). We could have just defined standard-monthly, but that way you could make free users subscribe to the free plan. This is useful for reporting for example (to track how long it took to upsell them, etc.)

Note that we haven't defined any trial period.

=== Creating your first account

We will assume that users going to your site have to create an account in your system. When they do, you will need to create a mirrored *account* in Kill Bill.

To do so in Kaui, click the CREATE NEW ACCOUNT link at the top of the page.

Notes:

* The Kill Bill *External key* field should map to the unique id of the account in your system (should be unique and immutable). Kill Bill will auto-generate an id if you don't populate this field
* There are many more fields you can store (phone number, address, etc.) -- all of them are optional. Keep local regulations in mind though when populating these (PII laws, GDPR, etc.).

=== Adding a payment method

To trigger payments, Kill Bill will need to integrate with a payment provider (such as Stripe or PayPal). Each means of payment (e.g. a credit card) will have a *payment method* associated with it.

For simplicity in this tutorial, we will assume your customers send you checks. To create the payment method in Kaui, click the + next to Payment Methods on the main account page. The plugin name should be set to $$__EXTERNAL_PAYMENT__$$, leave all other fields blank and make sure the checkbox Default Payment Method is checked.

Once you are ready to integrate with a real payment processor (see http://docs.killbill.io/latest/multi_gateways.html[this tutorial]), all you'll have to do is to create a new payment method for that account. The rest of this tutorial will still apply.

=== Creating your first subscription

Let's now try to subscribe a user to the Standard plan. This is the call that would need to be triggered from your website, when the user chooses the premium plan on the subscription checkout page.

In Kaui, click the Subscriptions tab then the + by *Subscription Bundles* (a subscription bundle is a collection, a _bundle_, of subscriptions, containing one base subscription and zero or more add-ons). Select the `standard-monthly` plan in the dropdown. You can also specify an optional (but unique) key to identify this subscription.

Because there is no trial period and because billing is performed in advance by default, Kill Bill will have automatically billed the user for the first month.

You should see the invoice and the payment by clicking on the Invoices and Payments tabs.

Kill Bill will now automatically charge the user on a monthly basis. You can estimate the amount which will be billed at a future date by triggering a dry-run invoice. On the main account page, in the Billing Info section, click the *Trigger invoice generation* wand (specify a date at least a month in the future).

== Using Kill Bill from your application

Now that you are familiar with the basics, the next step is to integrate Kill Bill in your application using our APIs. Our https://killbill.github.io/slate/[API documentation] contains snippets to help you get started.

We also have lots of examples in our https://github.com/killbill/killbill-integration-tests[Ruby] and https://github.com/killbill/killbill/tree/master/profiles/killbill/src/test/java/org/killbill/billing/jaxrs[Java] integration tests.

For support along the way, do *not* open GitHub issues. Instead, reach out to our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/killbilling-users[Google Groups].
