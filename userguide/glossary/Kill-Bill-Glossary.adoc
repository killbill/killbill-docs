== A

[[Account]]Account:: A record that contains details about the customer such as name, address, email address, phone number, etc. Also referred to as a "customer account."

{Charges for services provided at a later date.}

Billing in Arrears {Charges for services delivered in the previous billing period.}

Billing Mode:: 

Billing Period:: The frequency in which Kill Bill invoices the account for one or more subscriptions. (_Examples:_ DAILY, WEEKLY, BIWEEKLY, MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, BIANNUAL, ANNUAL, BIENNIAL, and NO_BILLING_PERIOD)

[[Bundle]]Bundle:: A collection of subscriptions associated with a single service instance. For example, a customer might have a base subscription for her phone, plus an add-on subscription for international dialing. Because both subscriptions are associated with the same phone, they are collected into a single bundle. An account may have several bundles, each with one or more subscriptions. Also known as a "subscription bundle."

== C

Catalog:: A description of the set of products, plans, phases, price lists, and rules that are available to customers. A catalog lets Kill Bill know what is being offered for sale and how much to charge for it.

[[Child]]Child:: An account that is associated with a parent account. Setting up a parent-child associations lets you define which entity is responsible for paying the invoice. See also <<Parent>>.

Credit


Customer:: The person who purchases a product or service from your organization. See also <<Account>>.

== D

Discount Phase:: A type of <<Phase,phase>> that defines a lower price for a set time period (after which the regular price automatically takes effect). A discount phase is specified as part of a <<Plan,plan>> within the <<Catalog,catalog>>.

Downgrade:: The change of a subscription from one plan to another plan of lesser dollar value.

{A downgrade is a change order or amendment to an existing contract or subscription in which a customer chooses a lower service level. A downgrade can be a less expensive service offering, or a smaller quantity or users or usage levels. Depending on business rules, this change can result in a prorated credit of the original service or a penalty fee associated with the change.}

Dunning
{The process of handling failed payments and declined credit cards to recover lost revenue.}

Duration:: Defines the length of time for a <<Phase,phase>>. Kill Bill supports durations of days, months, years or unlimited.

== E

Evergreen Phase:: A type of <<Phase,phase>> in which no end date is specified and Kill Bill continually bills the account for the subscription until the customer cancels it. A evergreen phase is specified as part of a <<Plan,plan>> within the <<Catalog,catalog>>.

External Key:: An alternative unique ID for an object, which you can use to map the object with an external resource. For example, you could define an external key for a specific customer account, which is the same as the identifier  used in your CRM system.

_Example:_

[cols="1"]

| *CRM Name:* Shirley Skinner

*CRM ID:* #4766gt53321#

Note that much of the representation of a payment method is plugin-specific and is actually stored by the payment plugin itself.

PCI Compliance
{ PCâ€‹I DSS (payment card industry data security standard)}
{The payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) is a set of requirements designed to ensure that all companies that process, store, or transmit credit card information maintain a secure environment.

[[Phase]]Phase:: The time periods within a plan. Kill Bill phases can be any of the following types: `TRIAL`, `DISCOUNT`, `FIXEDTERM`, or `EVERGREEN`. Note that a plan has at least one phase (i.e., a plan cannot be "empty" of phases.) A phase is also referred to as a "plan phase." See <<Plan>> below.

[[Plan]]Plan:: Details for the terms of the <<Subscription,subscription>> contract. In particular, plans define how much a customer pays for a product and how often they pay it (_Example:_ A Standard product at $100 per month). A plan consists of at least one phase and can have multiple phases (_Example:_ A discount phase followed by a regular price phase).

Price List:: One or more plans that have discount/special pricing. Price lists are defined in the <<Catalog,catalog>>.
Along with price lists, you define <<Rules,catalog rules>> that specify which price list to use if a customer changes plans.

Pricing Tiers
Also known as "tiered pricing" or "price tiers."
{A common subscription and usage charge model where pricing changes are based on the incremental number of units that are purchased. For example, 1-5 users are charged full price and 5-10 users receive discounted pricing. A customer purchases 7 units. Units 6 and 7 are discounted, and the first 5 units are charged at the full price.}

[[Product]]Product:: A product or service that the customer can purchase (or rent/lease). A product can be associated with multiple <<Plans,plans>>, each plan specifying different ways the product can be purchased (e.g., a monthly plan and an annual plan).

Proration
{Adjusting a customer's bill amount to reflect any plan changes made in the middle of a billing cycle.}

== Q

== R

Refund

{A refund returns money to a customer - as opposed to a credit, which creates a customer credit balance that may be applied to reduce the amount owed to you. For instance, refunds are used when a customer cancels service and is no longer your customer. Refunds can also represent processed payments that are reversed, such as a chargeback or a direct debit payment reversal.}

[[Rules]]Rules:: The rules that determine how Kill Bill should behave when a plan is created, cancelled or changed. Also known as "catalog rules."

== S

[[Subscription]]Subscription:: A contract between your organization and a customer to purchase a particular product/service with particular terms. Kill Bill associates a subscription with a <<Plan,plan>>, an <<Account,account>>, and a start date.

Subscription Bundle:: See <<Bundle>>

== T

Tag:: A property that can be added to objects (such as accounts, bundles or subscriptions). There are two kinds of Tags: system tags and user tags.

** System tags can impact the behavior of the system. Examples include `AUTO_PAY_OFF` or `AUTO_BILLING_OFF`.

** User Tags are informational only, and can be created through <<Kaui>>, the Kill Bill admin UI. User tags can be used to identify collections of accounts, subscriptions, or bundles so that they can easily be found or reported on later.

Tenant:: The division or organization that is using Kill Bill as a group of users. Note that an organization can have more than one tenant, as Kill Bill supports multitenancy.

Trial Phase:: A type of <<Phase,phase>> that defines a time period during which the account is not charged (or is heavily discounted). After the trial period, the regular price automatically takes effect. A trial phase is specified as part of a <<Plan,plan>> within the <<Catalog,catalog>>.

== U

Upgrade:: The change of a subscription from one plan to another plan of higher dollar value.

{A change order or amendment to an existing contract subscription in which a customer chooses a higher service level, such as a more expensive service offering, or a larger quantity of users.}

Usage Pricing

{Pricing a service or item based on its consumption or usage rather than a flat rate for a given service or period of time.}

User:: A person who logs on to Kaui.
