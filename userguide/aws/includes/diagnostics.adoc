The `diagnostic` option of the `Kill Bill Package Manager (kpm)` command creates an extensive report for a given tenant that may be useful for troubleshooting. See https://docs.killbill.io/latest/how-to-use-kpm-diagnostic[KPM Diagnostic Usage].

To run this command:

[source,bash]
----
# Login as 'tomcat'
> sudo su - tomcat
#
# Run the command with your access credentials:
#
> kpm  diagnostic \
  --account-export=<account_id> \
  --killbill-credentials=<ADMIN> <PASSWORD> \
  --bundles-dir=/var/lib/killbill/bundles \
  --killbill-api-credentials=<KEY> <SECRET> \
  --killbill-web-path=/var/lib/tomcat/webapps \
  --kaui-web-path=/var/lib/tomcat/webapps2 \
  --killbill-url=http://127.0.0.1:8080
----

You will need to edit this command to include:

1. Your admin username and password
2. The public key and secret key for your tenant (<KEY> <SECRET>)

The last line of the response should look like:

`Diagnostic data is exported under /tmp/killbill-diagnostics-20200213-23204-u93ah5/killbill-diagnostics-02-13-20.zip`

The specified zip file contains several reports of various sizes. This report can be downloaded to your computer using `sftp` and forwarded to Kill Bill for analysis.
