When you launch the EC2 instance,  all required services should be enabled and running, including:

* An instance of `nginx` receiving traffic on port `443` and `8443`
* An instance of Kill Bill server listening on `127.0.0.1:8080` (and receiving external traffic through nginx on port `8443`)
* An instance of Kaui listening on `127.0.0.1:3000` (and receiving external traffic through nginx on port `443`)
* A local `mysql` server running on port `3306`

The status of nginx/KB/mysql services can be checked by the following commands:

* Kill Bill service: `sudo service killbill status`
* Nginx service: `sudo service nginx status`
* Mysql service: `sudo service mysql status`

For each report there should be a line near the top with the following form:

`Active: active (running) since Sat 2020-10-24 20:13:43 UTC; 1 day 1h ago`

You can `start` or `stop` the services using similar commands, such as `sudo service killbill stop` to stop Kill Bill. If any service is not active, try starting it using the appropriate command.

If all services are running, the next step is to collect several reports.
