= How to Set up a Multi-Tier System


== Overview

This document describes the procedures for setting up Kill Bill under AWS using the multi-tier option. This is one of two recommended alternatives for production use. The multi-tier option requires more setup than CloudFormation, but provides more control over the deployment. The procedures in this document are based on the options recommended by Kill Bill.

This configuration uses two or more EC2 instances and a separate database provided by the AWS *Relational Database Service (RDS)*. It also includes an AWS *Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)* to correctly spread the traffic among the various nodes, and to route traffic to either the Kill Bill Server or Kaui based on the incoming port.

The diagram below shows the principal components of the multi-tier system: The ELB, the RDS, and two or more EC2 instances. Each EC2 is an instance of Ubuntu Linux, running both Kill Bill and Kaui within a `tomcat` server. Clients interact only with the ELB, which routes requests to the rest of the system.

These components will be installed in reverse order. First we setup the RDS databases. Next the EC2 instances are created. Finally, the ELB load balancer is installed to tie everything together.

The setup procedure includes eight steps:

. <<step1, Login to AWS>>
. <<step2, Setup the RDS>>
. <<step3, Edit the Configuration Script>>
. <<step4, Launch EC2 Instances>>
. <<step5, Create the Databases>>
. <<step6, Perform Initial Testing>>
. <<step7, Add the ELB>>
. <<step8, Perform Final Testing>>


[[step1]]
== Step 1: Login to AWS

To begin, log in to Amazon Web Services at https://aws.amazon.com. If you are new to AWS, you will be asked to create an account and provide billing information. You will need to sign in as a *Root User*. This should take you to the *AWS Management Console*, which provides links to all available services.

Check the upper right corner of your screen to be sure you are in the appropriate *region*. All resources you create will be placed in this region, and may not be accessible from other regions.

In addition, AWS places all resources within a *Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)*. A default VPC will be created and used automatically in the following steps. However, if you have access to other VPCs, you will need to ensure that all Kill Bill resources are deployed in the same one.

[[step2]]
== Step 2: Setup the RDS

Once you are logged in, the first step is to setup the Relational Database System. This process begins with the RDS dashboard, which should be available from the Services menu. When the dashboard appears, select *Databases* from the left menu, and click the red button at the top right that reads *Create Database*:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-create-database.png[align=center]

=== 2.1. Set the Configuration

You will be taken to the *Create Database* page. The first choice you will have is between *Standard Create*, which allows you to set a full range of configuration parameters, or *Easy Create*, which sets most of these parameters to defaults. Select *Easy Create*.

image::../assets/aws/multitier-standard-or-easy.png[align=center]

The next section offers you a choice of several database types. Kill Bill can work with any database type that is `mysql` or `postgres` compatible. For robust production use, Amazon Aurora is probably a good choice. Here we will illustrate the simpler steps setting up a MariaDB database.

image::../assets/aws/multitier-database-types.png[align=center]

The next choice determines the instance size. We suggest the *Production* option as this will provide the most robust configuration.

image::../assets/aws/multitier-instance-sizes.png[align=center]

The last section asks you to:

1. Specify a name for your database
2. Give a username for the administrative account (we suggest that you do *not* use the default name)
3. Provide a password for the administrative acount (we suggest you let AWS generate one for you)

image::../assets/aws/multitier-names-and-password.png[align=center]

=== 2.2. Create the Database Manager

When the password is setup and confirmed, click *Create Database* in the lower right corner. You will return to the main Databases screen, which should now look like this:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-database-starting.png[align=center]

This display shows that your database is starting. After a few minutes, the status will change to *Available* (You may need to reload the page to see this). You will also have a chance to see the password, in case it was autogenerated. Save this password, as you will need it later.

At this time you can click on the database name to get more information. You should see a panel named *Connectivity and Security*. The left side of this panel shows the full name of the endpoint, which you will need shortly, and the port number, which is normally 3306.

image::../assets/aws/multitier-connectivity-and-security.png[align=center]

=== 2.3. Setup the Security Rules

Lastly, on the *Connectivity and Security* panel, locate and click on the link for the default VPC security group. You will need to add an inbound security rule, because the database by default does not allow external access. In the panel for this group, click on *Inbound Rules* and select *Edit Inbound Rules*. Next click on *Add rule*. In the *Type* column select `MYSQL/Aurora`. The port will be set to 3306 automatically. In the *Source* column, click on the search icon and select `0.0.0.0/0`. Finally, click on *Save Rules* in the bottom right. Your database is ready to go.

[[step3]]
== Step 3: Edit the Configuration Script

To set up the EC2 instances you will need to provide them with information needed to connect to the databases. We provide a brief configuration script to simplify this process. The template for this script is as follows:


[source,bash]
----
#!/bin/bash

DB_PROPS="/var/tmp/db.props.$$"
KB_PROPS="/var/tmp/kb.props.$$"

cat <<_EOF > $DB_PROPS
#
# EDIT THE FOLLOWING DB PROPERTIES AS NEEDED:
#
DB_SERVER=<DB-INSTANCE-NAME>:3306
DB_USER=<ADMIN-NAME>
DB_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
KILLBILL_DB_NAME=killbill
KAUI_DB_NAME=kaui
_EOF

cat <<_EOF > $KB_PROPS
#
# EDIT THE FOLLOWING KB PROPERTIES AS NEEDED:
#
org.killbill.dontexist=foo
_EOF

su -l -c "cd /var/lib/tomcat/bin && /var/lib/tomcat/bin/updateProperties.sh $DB_PROPS $KB_PROPS" tomcat
----

First, you need to edit the database properties. <DB-INSTANCE-NAME> should be replaced by the full name of the DB endpoint, as given in the *Connectivity and Security* panel (see above). The port number 3306 is required. <ADMIN-NAME> and <PASSWORD> should be set to the administrator credentials you have chosen for the RDS instance.

Second, you may optionally edit any Kill Bill properties that you need to change from the standard defaults. For more information see the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/userguide_configuration.html[Kill Bill Configuration Guide].

Save this script in a text file. You will need it in the next step.

[[step4]]
== Step 4: Launch EC2 Instances

The next step is to launch the number of EC2 instances you want, all based on the Kill Bill single AMI.


=== 4.1. Subscribe to the AMI

To start the installation process, point your browser to the 
+++
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_"
onclick="getOutboundLink('https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B083LYVG9H?ref=_ptnr_doc_');
return false;">
Kill Bill AMI at AWS Marketplace
</a>
+++.

You should see the following image at the top of your screen:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-subscribe.png[align=center]

Click *Continue to Subscribe*. The next page will give the AWS Terms and Conditions:

Accept the terms if asked. You will then see a new message confirming that you have subscribed. Next, click *Continue to Configuration*.

=== 4.2. Configure the Instances

The next page will give several configuration options:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-configure.png[align=center]

Be sure to select the region you plan to operate in. Accept the other defaults. Then click *Continue to Launch*.

The next page will give you several options for the launch method. Choose *Launch through EC2*.

image::../assets/aws/multitier-launch.png[align=center]

All other options will disappear. Click *Launch*.

The next page is headed *Launch an Instance*. There are several things you will need to do here.

First, at the top right, select the number of instances you will use. We recommend 2. You can add more later.

Next, scroll down to the middle of this page, to the box titled *Key Pair (login)* Here you are asked to choose or create a *key pair*.

image::../assets/aws/single-tier-keypair.png[align=center]

The key pair provides the credentials you will need to login to your EC2 instance. For details about key pairs, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[AWS documentation]. We recommend that you create a new key pair. Click *Create Key Pair* to display a pane to be used for the creation. Give the key pair a simple, easy to remember name such as `My-Key-Pair`. Do not change the other options on this pane. Then click *Download Key Pair*. Important: You *must* save the private key that will be generated in this step. If you lose this key, you will *not* be able to login to your instance.

Finally, scroll to the bottom and open the section labeled *Advanced Details*. You will see a long list of settings. At the very bottom of this list is a box headed *User Settings*. Copy your configuration file into this box.

=== 4.3. Launch your Instances

When the key pair is generated, click *Launch Instances*. You should see the screen below:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-launching.png[align=center]

Your instances are finally launching! To follow what is happening on the EC2 Dashboard, scroll all the way down to the bottom, and click *View all instances* at the bottom right. This will take you to the *Instances* screen which is part of the EC2 Dashboard.

image::../assets/aws/multitier-instances.png[align=center]


In a short time, the *Instance State* for each instance should indicate *Running*. You will need to scroll to the right to see all of the information available about your instances. In particular, make a note of the *Availability Zone* (such as `us-east-1a`) assigned to each instance. You will need this information later.

=== 4.4. Setup Security Rules

The next step is to scroll down in the menu on the left side to select *Security Groups*. You should see a list of two or more groups. Select the group whose name begins with `Kill Bill on AWS`, then scroll to the bottom and select the tab for *Inbound Rules*. You should see:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-inbound-original.png[align=center]

These rules enable the ports that must be open to access Kaui and Kill Bill from a browser. However, for access through the ELB these ports will be different. In addition, to enable direct login to your instance using SSH, you need to add one more port.

Click on *Edit Inbound Rules*. then do the following:

1. For the rule that specifies Type: HTTPS, Port Range: 443, change the type to CUSTOM TCP and the Port Range to 3000.
2. For the rule that specifies Type: CUSTOM TCP, Port Range: 8443, change the Port Range to 8080.
3. Finally, add a rule with the following elements: Type: SSH, Protocol: TCP, Port Range: 22, Source: 0.0.0.0/0.


Your Inbound Rules should now look like this:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-inbound-new.png[align=center]


=== 4.5. Login to an Instance

Now that your instances are set up, you need to ensure that you can login to them for configuration and maintenance when needed. To login, use the secure shell command:

`ssh -i <PRIVATE_KEY>.pem ubuntu@<INSTANCE_IP>`

Here <PRIVATE_KEY> is the pathname where you have stored the private key that was downloaded when you generated your key pair, and <INSTANCE_IP> is the IPV4 address for any one of your instances as described earlier. The private key will not work unless its access controls are set to readable by the owner only.

On Windows versions before Windows 10, you may need to download a program called PuTTY to enable `ssh`. On Windows 10 `ssh` is available but may need to be activated through the Settings screen.

The first time you login, you will see a warning message asking if you want to add this host to your list of hosts. You should answer `yes`.

You will now be able to explore your instance and perform various configuration and maintenance tasks. To exit from your login, type `exit`.

NOTE: We recommend that you *remove* the SSH rule from your security group when you are *not* doing configuration or maintenance.


[[step5]]
== Step 5: Create the Databases

Kill Bill requires two databases, with the names `killbill` and `kaui`. We provide predefined schemas for these databases.

To create the databases, you will need to login to one of your instances as described above. Once you are logged in, you can use the `mysql` command to create the two databases `killbill` and `kaui`. The credentials for this command are the same ones you set up for the database and copied to the configuration file. Note that the <DB-INSTANCE-NAME> should *not* include the port number.

The password will not be echoed when it is typed.

[source,bash]
----
> mysql -h <DB-INSTANCE-NAME> -u <ADMIN-NAME> -p
Enter Password:
mysql> create database killbill;
mysql> create database kaui;
mysql> exit
----
The next step is to install the schemas. These can be found at:

* killbill schema: `https://docs.killbill.io/latest/ddl.sql`
* kaui schema: `https://github.com/killbill/killbill-admin-ui/blob/master/db/ddl.sql`

One easy way to do this is to return to your local computer (type `exit`) and download the schemas (give them distinct names), then use the `sftp` command to upload them to your EC2 instance home directory with the commands:

[source,bash]
----
sftp -i PRIVATE_KEY.pem ubuntu@INSTANCE_IP
put killbill.ddl
put kaui.ddl
exit
----

Once the files are successfully uploaded, login again to your instance using the `ssh` command. You can now install the schemas:

[source,bash]
----
> mysql -h DB-INSTANCE-NAME -u ADMIN-NAME -p killbill < killbill.ddl
Enter Password:
> mysql -h DB-INSTANCE-NAME -u ADMIN-NAME -p kaui < kaui.ddl
Enter Password:
----
To ensure that the databases are setup correctly, login to `mysql` again, then try the SHOW TABLES command:

[source,bash]
----
> mysql -h DB-INSTANCE-NAME -u ADMIN-NAME -p
Enter Password:
use killbill
show tables;
use kaui
show tables;
exit
----

Each `show tables` command should display a list of table names for the database.

[[step6]]
== Step 6: Perform Initial Testing

You can now login to Kaui from your browser using the URL `\http://<INSTANCE_IP>:3000`, where `<INSTANCE_IP>` is the IPV4 address for one of your instances, given on your dashboard as *Public IPV4 Address*. This should display the Kaui login screen. For an introduction to Kaui, see our https://docs.killbill.io/latest/quick_start_with_kaui.html[Quick Start with Kaui] guide. The default credentials are: `admin` / `<INSTANCE_ID>`, where <INSTANCE_ID> is the AWS ID for the same instance you selected for login.

In addition, you can login to the Kill Bill server using the URL `\http://<INSTANCE_IP>:8080`. This provides access to certain detailed reports that may be needed for maintenance, including metrics, event logs, and the Swagger API pages.

Repeat the tests for your other instance(s). If these logins succeed, your EC2 instances and your RDS databases are setup properly.


[[step7]]
== Step 7: Add the ELB

The last major task is to setup the Elastic Load Balancer in front of the EC2 instances.

=== 7.1. Select the ELB type

To begin, from the EC2 dashboard scroll down the left-hand menu and select *Load Balancing / Load Balancers*. Then click the  *Create Load Balancer* button at the upper left.

You will be given a choice of several load balancer types. The type we will use is *Application Load Balancer*. Click on the *Create* button in the Application Load Balancer box. This will bring up the page titled *Create Application Load Balancer*. This is your master page for the load balancer creation.

=== 7.2. Set Basic Configuration

In the section headed *Basic Configuration*, give your load balancer a name. Do not change the other settings.

In the *Network Mappings* section, select *at least two* availability zones. These *must* include the availability zones assigned to each of your EC2 instances (which you took note of earlier).

=== 7.3. Setup a Security Group

The next section is headed *Security Groups*. Click on *create new security group*. This will open a page headed *Create security group*.

We will use the secure protocol `HTTPS` (based on TLS) for users to access your system. This will require you to provide or create a certificate in a later step.

Enter a name and a brief description for your security group. The description cannot be empty. Then setup the Inboud Rules as follows:

image::../assets/aws/multitier-inbound-original.png[align=center]

When your security group is set, return to the master page and select this group from the dropdown list. You may need to use the refresh icon to make your new group appear in the list. Delete any other group that remains selected.

=== 7.4. Create Listeners

The next section is titled *Listeners and Routing*. This is the last section you will have to deal with, but it is very important. This is where you will setup the Listeners that will receive requests for Kaui or Kill Bill and pass them on to the appropriate modules in your EC2 instances.

Initially you will see one listener, set with protocol HTTP and Port 80. Change the protocol to HTTPS and the port to 443. A new section will open up, headed *Secure listener settings*:

image::../assets/aws/ELB-secure-listener.png[align=center]

Here you will be required to create or provide an X.509 SSL Certificate. If you already have a certificate you can identify it or upload it here. Otherwise click on *Request a New Certificate from ACM.* This will enable you to create a certificate using the *Amazon Certificate Manager*. Follow the steps described for the ACM in https://docs.killbill.io/latest/how-to-add-a-certificate-using-ACM.html[Add a Certificate Using the Amazon Certificate Manager], then return to this page. Select your new certificate from the dropdown list. You can now proceed to the next step.

Next you will need to click on *Add Listener* to create a second Listener. This listener will use port 8443. 


=== 7.5. Setup Target Groups

The next step is to identify the *target* instances for your load balancer, which are collected into a *target group*. Each listener will have a separate target group. Note that the display for each listener contains a link labeled *Create target group*. Click on this link for the first listener.  This will setup the routing for messages directed to Kaui.

Your group will consist of all of the instances you have launched. First, create the group, give it a simple name, and set the port to 3000:

image::../assets/aws/ELB-configure-routing.png[align=center]

Now click on *Next*, to open a page titled *Register Targets*. The purpose of this step is to identify the target instances that will be part of your target group. Initially, all your instances will be listed at the top. To register them, select them all and click *Include as pending below*. The instances will now be listed in the bottom section. Proceed to *Next: Review*. If all looks well, click on *Create Target Group*. This will bring you to the *Target groups* page, and your new group should appear.

Now return to the master page where you created the listeners. Click on the refresh icon for the first listener, then select your new target group from the dropdown list.

image::../assets/aws/ELB-listener-with-TG.png[align=center]


Next, you need to perform the same steps for the second listener. This listener will handle messages directed to the Kill Bill server. Click the link on the second listener labeled *Create target group*. Follow the same steps, setting the port this time to 8080.

When both target groups are setup, you will have a chance to review your settings, then proceed to the next section.


=== 7.6. Create the Load Balancer

Check all settings, then click *Create*. Your load balancer will be created. Close the final page to see the Load Balancer list. The initial status for your new ELB will be *provisioning*. After a few minutes this will change to *active*.

[[step8]]
== Step 8: Perform Final Testing

When your ELB is complete you can proceed to testing. You should now be able to login to Kaui from your browser using the URL `\https://kaui.<DOMAIN>`, where <DOMAIN> is *your* domain that you have used for your certificate. The Kaui login screen should appear, as in Step 6. Similarly, you should be able to login directly to the Kill Bill server using the URL `\https://kaui.<DOMAIN>:8443`.

If these logins do not work correctly, review your setup steps carefully, then proceed to the https://docs.killbill.io/latest/how-to-maintain-a-multi-tier-system.html[Multi-Tier Maintenance Guide].

Congratulations! Your multi-tier installation is ready to go!
